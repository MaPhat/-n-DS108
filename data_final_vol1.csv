erma harris,6-Apr-24,5,I liked small cans just enough very tasty
Very good by harold,6-Mar-24,5,I love buying things from Amazon because 99% or a good quality the only bad experience I had was with the air mattress wait on it two nights when nothing on and it popped I think it was a manufacturing defect I've had air mattresses all my life and never had one pop like this one did and it was in the scene where it opened up
Samia,28-Feb-24,5,Love these mini cans because I can never finish the regular size! Tastes great and is good pricing.
Asia,24-Feb-24,5,Great taste & quantity!
Larry,10-Jan-24,4,"Pepsi, a standard, but where are the Dr. Peppers? We want our Dr. Pepper (PLEASE !)."
R. Vicevich,2-Nov-23,5,"As a human with a love for all things refreshing, I couldn't help but write a review about the amazing Pepsi Zero drink. Not only does it have zero sugar and calories, but the taste is also incredible. But what truly captured my heart was the old school logo. It's a nostalgic reminder of the classic Pepsi taste that has been a staple in my life for years. Every time I take a sip of this refreshing drink, I am transported back to my childhood memories. So if you're looking for a delicious and guilt-free beverage, Pepsi Zero is the way to go. And with the added bonus of the old school logo, it's a no-brainer for me. I highly recommend giving it a try!"
Cloven,7-Feb-24,5,My favorite drink we get 2 or 3 cases every 2 weeks.
Amazon Customer,3-Feb-24,5,I love this drink
Erica B,1-Dec-23,5,"Delicious. Hits better than a Coke Zero and this is coming from someone who prefers Coke to Pepsi normally. Don’t get me wrong, I will still drink an original Coke over a Pepsi product, but when it comes to sugar free, you can’t go wrong with this bevvy. Me and my fiancés both agree that even though we like Coke Zero, this far exceeds Coke Zero’s taste."
ARC.WSI,23-Jan-24,5,"yummy, that’s all folks"
alvin,11-Jan-24,5,How to find which sellers accept SNAP?
Lee,13-Aug-23,4,"Coke zero is my favorite diet cola. The cans arrived bashed up at the ends that you had to open. Made it difficult to pop the tops. Don't know if I would order cans again. Amazon has big problems keeping Coca-Cola in stock. I usually purchase the bottles IF they're available, big IF. This was the first time I ordered cans, and wasn't pleased in the condition of cans."
Terri,9-Nov-23,5,Arrived in excellent condition. Glad that I didn't hesitate to go for this. May be different depending on what time of year that you purchase. Bitter cold temperatures can affect the condition that the cans arrive in.
OldieButGoodie,9-Dec-23,5,Sugar free Mango is a satisfying drink for a diet soda. 5 stars.
Meglet,23-Apr-22,5,"I love mango but did NOT expect this to taste good at all, let alone be my new favorite. It is VERY mango-y. I am trying to drink much less soda, so I certainly discovered this at the wrong time for that!Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how I see it, it is very hard to find. So, I’m stocking up a bit at a time, because that’s all I ever come across. I will not buy the really expensive listing, though. Not unless I come to real desperation. Soda should not be a monetary splurge as well as a dietary one. (Well, maybe it should, if it limits intake of something so patently unhealthy as it is yummy!)That’s the risk of liking something unusual like this - and I don’t know if this is limited edition or just less stocked - but if you love it, you’re then stuck chasing more, or eventually having to just enjoy it in sweet memory. And it is very sweet, but Pepsi already is a very sweet cola, so I don’t mind it. With the choice between Regular Pepsi and Mango Pepsi, I’d go for Mango every time, and going back to Regular will be strange. So, again, perhaps it’s an altogether good thing I’m drinking soda less and less!"
Kimberly Greenlaw,20-Dec-23,5,Good value
Rheann Y,6-Dec-23,5,It's Pepsi what's there to say
dennis,10-Apr-23,5,My brother and sister said they didn't like it.Well my sister actually tried it.my brother just said it sounded gross.Heck I mixed dr pepper cream soda with the mango Pepsi and heck I didn't even think that sounded gross by any means yet it definitely sounds more gross then mango Pepsi.I truthfully think I found the pepsi I prefer and it would be the new mango Pepsi.Whats odd is that I tried mango Pepsi in a can and also the plastic bottle and I normally prefer the plastic bottles cause it usually has a better fizz to the soda in the 16.9 plastic bottle but with the mango Pepsi I truthfully prefer the cans.kind of odd but yes I actually think the mango Pepsi is pretty darn good
Trashman,8-Nov-23,5,Everyone in my family like Pepsi 0.There are four diabetics in our house and Pepsi 0 is our first choice.
PD-68,11-Sep-23,5,One good thing about drinking from the mini cans is controlling the intake of soda. Pepsi mini cans are also a lot cheaper than mini plastic bottles and better for recycling. It still has the same Pepsi taste and the size cold help you stash more in a small ice chest.
Ruperta,3-Dec-23,5,Very satisfy
no name should be private,4-Nov-23,5,Tastes better than the ones with sugar .... sugar is bad for humans!
Mr. Campbell,13-Jul-22,4,"It’s soda.. people know what Pepsi is and really don’t need a review for Pepsi. But for price and amount of cans is fine I guess. America is corrupt anyway. 24 ounce of Pepsi costs more than a 2 liter of Pepsi of the same flavor. So spend less to drink more soda? Or get a case and try to have more self control with each can. If your teeth get messed up from drinking soda just remember Pepsi doesn’t care !! They got your money and that’s all that matters to them.If you do want to choose to drink soda, space it out and think of it as a treat. Not a everyday drink!! Soda shouldn’t be consumed more than twice a week at the most! You only get one body, treat it well! Kidney stones and more is something you don’t want later on in life!! Be smart and respect the body you were assigned to!!"
Jessica McMullen,9-Nov-23,5,Great zero sugar soda.
Amazon Customer,18-Sep-23,5,"I wish more care was taken so cans won't arrive damaged, but am glad they arrive in a timely manner."
Texas Family,18-Oct-23,5,Never a disappointment!
Bobbie B.,17-Oct-23,5,No dislikes 
Melody Johnson,18-Sep-23,5,Arrived fast and day early-- love when that happens.
LynnZ.,3-Aug-23,5,I really like these new Zero Sugar sodas as opposed to the former “diet” sodas. These are cleaner tasting and don’t leave any off-taste after drinking.
Amazon customer ,31-Jul-23,5,Love these cans cold from the fridge! They are great when I get a chance to try them! Will definitely purchase them again!
KA LaMesa,22-Jul-23,5,loved the more compact packaging - Can you put the whole box in the refrigerator that uses horizontal and vertical space better than the longer narrow boxes
Tristan Robinson,19-May-23,4,"It was delicious, but man I wish these came in bigger sizes"
Eric ,25-Aug-23,5,If you don’t know what Cherry Pepsi is I can’t help you
max garcia,22-Sep-23,5,mmmmmm pepsi
JR,27-Jul-23,5,No early expiration date and tastes exactly like Pepsi should. No big surprise
Jean Willard,2-Jan-23,4,My elderly mother likes these drinks. I know it wasn’t your fault but 2 cans were busted. I knew it when the box came shipped wet. Thanks Have a wonderful holiday
R. W. Young,12-Oct-23,3,It is not a good replacement for my fave Cherry Coke Zero. That is all.
P,10-May-23,5,My friends and family all disagree with me but I think that Pepsi is so much better that it’s competitor (you know who). Who doesn’t like a 24 pack. The more the merrier.
Sheila Clark,5-Apr-23,4,I love my Pepsi zero sugar.
James,2-Jun-23,5,"The Pepsi has a bubble fun factor, thanks to carbonation. When stored in the refrigerator, the cans can become chilled, and enhance the drinking experience."
M U Haque,12-Mar-23,4,It was tasty and value for money with the price
Kristi Salvatierra,8-Aug-23,5,I love the taste
Jaime,4-Oct-23,3,You can’t really taste the peach flavor. But the pineapple ones from Little Caesars are great.
G. A SENDEROFF,9-Dec-22,5,"I purchased this to try it, almost as a joke but me and my wife are definitely loving it. We have ordered 6 cases just in case they stop making this flavor, it is that good. If you like mango flavor, do not think twice, this item is ridiculously great even though it sounds like it does not go together - it really does!"
Margie H. Adams,16-Feb-23,4,One was no good. Had seal broken and leaked.
Lars Asken,22-May-23,5,I drink Pepsi Zero almost every day and these mini's are just the right amount for a quick drink
Lena Port,4-Aug-22,5,I'm not a Pepsi drinker anymore it doesn't taste like you used to taste when I was coming up and now I drink Coca-Cola cuz it gives me that burp then I'm that I need that I can't get from Pepsi 7UP and Sprite gives me a good burp but nothing like a Coke can and when I can't find a Coke I will drink a Pepsi it's good but Coke is better
Elaine Banks,30-Dec-22,5,"I can’t get enough of this flavor! The mango is not overwhelming but just enough that it compliments the Pepsi. I add some French vanilla coffee creamer and it’s absolutely delicious, like a soda float minus the thickness. I ALWAYS have this soda stocked up in my fridge."
Sha,11-May-23,5,We bought these as a gift and they were very pleased to receive them.
Arlene Young,10-Mar-23,5,I’ve always loved Pepsi! Just the right amount of sweetness and it tastes good every time. I personally like warm sodas because to me they taste really shines through
Kymberlyn A Reed (The Fountain Pen Diva),7-Oct-22,5,"While I've cut way down on my carbonated soda intake, Mango Pepsi is my favorite guilty (not guilty) pleasure. The mango flavor is just a party to my taste buds. I bought the 12 pack and may have to stock up because Pepsi will stop making this - Boo - instead of keeping a permanent flavor."
Jorge Urdaneta,16-Nov-22,5,This is great to control how much soda you're drinking. You don't really need to get the bigger can.Also for mixing drinks is great because you have less possibility of leaving some content in the can between drinks. You will open a new can more often. Less flat soda in your drinks.
Bebe Washington,14-Nov-22,4,We don’t drink much soda. But this purchase was a great choice. We were surprised by the very present mango flavor.
Jannine E Zerres,28-Dec-22,4,I want to reduce waste. Perfect size
Kellz,29-Dec-22,4,Still the best cola to me
John,26-Jan-22,5,"The best new flavor Pepsi has made in years! But it’s so hard to find in the Northeast. Only the regular Pepsi mango appears to be sold in stores. What is going on with the availability of P M Zero? Is it being discontinued or phased out for another flavor? Whatever the case may be, get this Pepsi mango zero while you still can! It’s a great soda with a unique and appealing flavor."
Mickey 55,21-Feb-23,5,Sometimes You don't need to have a big can or bott;e to keep you satisfied. This does the trick at a great price.
sportyrider,5-Jul-22,5,Cutting down on calories but craving a soft drink? This one's for you. I've been a PEPSI lover for years but don't need the sugar and calories as I age. A couple times a week I have a small Pepsi just to remind me of the good old days when we consumed the 12oz cans like water.
AlbericM,17-Jan-23,5,"While I'll always take Pepsi over Coke, their new flavors make the old standard more fun. Mango seems to be a good match, and it's almost a regular buy now."
Kiwi,9-Jul-22,5,I have always loved Pepsi and wanted to try the Pepsi Mango becuz it was made by Pepsi.I must say that I was really surprised about the mango flavor! It is not overbearing as I thought it would be. I order this as often as I can along with regular Pepsi.Highly recommended.
AlohaJohn,25-May-14,5,"This is an incredible buy for urban Amazonians and those of us in high cost-of-living areas. As cities and states try to tax soft drinks-many having failed because of the Sugar and HFCS lobbies---we all need to start consuming less of this stuff. Many have commented that the price per ounce is a ripoff. But you are missing the point. It's a 100 calorie can that is great for restricting all the sugar none of us needs. These little packs sell in Hawaii for $3.99 or $4.99 and maybe on Sale at 2 for $6 (Matching this Amazon Price). But you have to also pay sales tax of 4.17% and Beverage Container Recycling fee of 5 cents per can in HI. Yeah, per ounce it's more, but I'm old enough to remember Soda in Bottles that were 6-1/2 ounces that grew to 10 oz. when brands were competing in the 60s-70s, and containers continued to grow---our collective waistlines along with them. So for me these are great, and I save on gas driving to the store because Amazon delivers these right to my door. Aloha and Mahalo!!!"
EAMommy,15-Oct-22,5,"I wasn't sure if this product would be good but I was pleasantly surprised. I order it on a regular basis now. If you're a diet pepsi fan, this is a nice little change from the norm. And it tastes REALLY good with rum!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
P.retty B.oy T.actix,16-Mar-23,5,ARRIVED AT MY DOOR WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FRIDGE AFTER I OPENED ONE mmmmm
Lana,20-Mar-23,5,"If you ever will see at the any store, just grab it, very tasty!"
Darlene S,11-Jan-23,5,"Yep, I've been a fan for years and years. I have no business drinking it but diet pepsi and Pepsi Zero both taste too sweet to me."
Willie V. Hughes,25-Jun-21,5,"Pepsi Max aka Pepsi Zero Sugar Cola is Pepsi's best diet cola, hands down. Diet Pepsi tastes like sweet battery acid. Diet Coke tasks like bitter battery acid. But Pepsi, Zero Sugar is actually pretty good, and passable as a regular cola. The caffeine content of Pepsi, Zero Sugar is also the highest of any cola outside Jolt, so that's a nice little kick of energy right there."
Deb M.,6-Nov-22,5,These compact cans are great as they take up little space in the fridge. Also satisfies when you have a taste for Pepsi. Only complaint is that price has increased (along with everything else we buy.)
Christine Piff,22-Oct-22,5,I like the size of these cans. They are excellent for kids and people who don't drink alot of soda products. They were packaged well to ship them without any damage to the cans. I buy frequently and recommend purchasing them.
Maggie Razzi,26-Apr-23,5,Great when in stock
Cynthia Medina,9-Mar-22,4,"Although the taste is never affected, the cans I have always ordered in the boxes have always been dirty and sticky. I am glad I have always washed the cans and also put in a separate cup."
Wayne summers,24-Apr-23,5,The media could not be loaded. Always dented cans
Hic Svnt Dracones,14-Jul-22,4,"This is the eclosest I have found to regular sugared pepsi, it isn't perfect though, still has an after taste that drives me nuts."
MauraLJ,12-Mar-22,5,"Perfect to pack for small person snack or if you have small amounts of room. Easy to monitor intake with kids because the size is great for the young ones. My local store wants almost a dollar more per pack, so this is where I buy mine."
TKT,27-Jul-21,5,"Although it is extremely overpriced, I think it’s selling for $55 for a 15 pack of 12 oz cans…I will put a mango in my Diet Pepsi before paying that ludicrous amount. I’m sure it will be discontinued soon. Do to what? Lack of customers? Anyone I talked to didn’t even know it existed, greedy sales persons? I love it but not for $55"
MK.,21-Sep-22,5,"My child and I drink these whenever we can order them, and they are tasty like happy juice. Definitely a sometimes treat, but wow is the mango flavor strongly blended with the Pepsi flavor."
Timothy Jackson,2-Jul-22,4,I like the fact that they come in a mixed assortment great for company and you never know what flavor you're going to get 😉
Clay,21-Sep-22,4,"Wish it was better priced, everything so expensive now"
DEBORAH TYLER,6-Jun-22,5,Pepsi mango zero is awesome... yes mango is an acquired taste...not for everybody...just cause some of ya all don't like the flavor doesn't mean it's nasty...my family loves it and with zero sugar it's a win win in my household!!!
lplynn,19-Nov-22,5,I'll take Pepsi over Coke every time. 24 cans for under $12 is a great price.
Barbara Smith,8-Apr-22,5,Love this flavor but unable to get it in zero sugar version in my location. Was fast delivery. Tried ordering this from other suppliers but only wasted my time. This one delivered the goods. Arrived early and well packed so none was dented.
Joyce Aziz,13-Oct-21,5,I don’t know why I thought that the taste was not going to be artificial lol but kept on seeing it on tv and decided to try it. I feel like it taste even more sugary than regular Pepsi. Must be the added ingredients for the mango taste. It’s ok though and the kids love it
Dennis Vanmeter,28-Mar-22,4,Perfect Lil size for those who don't want a full can not a bad deal at all for delivery I will buy again
Theresa Gregory,15-Feb-23,5,gift SURPRISE as this loved Grandkids My
Winnie M Peric,29-Sep-22,5,"My Son Daniel doesn't drink coffee, so he gets this, the size it just Enough Although he would LOVE to have the Cherry Pepsi more!!!"
D.L.C.,25-Jun-22,5,"My family and I were surprised at how good and balanced the mango flavor was. For us there was no ""diet soda"" aftertaste. Pretty sure we found our new favorite zero calorie soda."
Theodore R Stauffer,14-Jul-22,5,Love this soda. Hard to find in the local grocery at times. Whole family loves it. Wish it were a bit cheaper but all soda seems to be expensive these days.
NestT,7-Apr-21,4,"It was pretty much what I expected. The initial flavor is traditional Pepsi cola then the ""splash of mango"" comes in the form of a mild aftertaste.I would have preferred two splashes but it is fine. Ergo 4 stars not five. I will probably buy again but not on the regular."
Peggy Yadon,9-Apr-22,5,I just love the mango flavor. Just the right amount of sweetness and I love having one in the evening a few hours after supper. Zero calories but it makes me feel like I’m enjoying a dessert.
Vicki Hopkins,3-Jan-23,5,About 2 cans damaged like size less waste being small.
Arleata ,23-Aug-22,4,Buy often
Amazon Customer,24-May-22,4,Mango is a bit strong but the Pepsi taste is still there!
Poetic Chaos,21-Jul-22,4,It was pretty good to my surprise.
Placeholder,22-Feb-22,4,Just regular Pepsi...was good value...but now Price Jumped...not happy about it..happening to all items I consistently buy...wacked out algorithm!!
bernard brantley,13-Jun-21,4,"Product was to high, now but in stores for 4.00 , love to have 20oz bottles but 35 dollars is to high, when they come down I’ll buy, Pepsi 0 mango in 20 oz bottles,"
Kevin Bender,27-Mar-15,5,"Don't believe the detractors. For some reason, the 12 oz. cans of Pepsi just taste flat after drinking from the 7.5 oz. cans. There's also a bit of a calorie discrepancy, which would lead me to believe that the mix isn't quite the same between the two, as the number of calories in the 7.5 oz. cans is equal to the number of calories in 2/3 of the 12 oz. cans if the labels are accurate. Either way, you're controlling your intake better by going with the smaller cans. It's to be expected that they're more expensive per ounce, but what food or drink isn't? Note that there are eight cans per pack of 7.5 oz. cans as opposed to the six cans in the packs of 12 oz. cans."
Terry J Barnes,13-Sep-22,5,I like these little Mini Pepsi cans just the right size for me for a quick drink thanks Terry J Barnes

Max,6-Apr-24,5,"Had to try this and see if it tastes like store bought.I have a sodastream terra. I use filtered water as cold as I can get it without freezing.I like my water very fizzy. Terra instructions say up to 5 pumps, I do 6.Syrup instructions say to fill the cap up the middle line.Tried this, I thought the flavor was a bit weak.The next time, I tried a full cap full. Up to the line at the top of the cap.I thought this was very close to a store bought pepsi.I will be buying this again.Same for Starry. Full cap instead of half. I will buy again"
Trey,6-Jan-24,4,"The SodaStream Pepsi Zero Sugar Beverage Mix offers a delightful way to enjoy your favorite Pepsi flavor with the convenience and customization of SodaStream.

The taste is authentic, the process is fun and easy, and the result is always deliciously satisfying. Highly recommend for soda lovers looking for a convenient, sugar-free option!"
Ash Jade,31-Mar-24,5,"Me and my sister bought this because we were spending a lot of money on soda for a family of 4. I came across this pack on Amazon. Everywhere else in the major stores that sell Sodastream products cost way much more! This pack saved us a lot of money on soda and lasted us 3 months of making liters daily. I also recommend if you use your Sodastream often, get a Brita filter pitcher to save on water. The flavors are a greta choice for dark and clear soda lovers. I usually use half way of the measure cup with 4 pumps of C02 for optimum accuracy of authentic flavor. I will say it slightly taste like diet soda but all of the Sodastream flavors taste like that unless you go online and buy the soda syrup they sell for machines you see in fast food restaurants. Theones for soda stream with real sugar are really expensive I will say after research.Overall, I reccommend this set to save money by stocking up or if you have a large family of soda lovers."
Holly Blackmon,11-Apr-24,5,Love that I can have these at home and not be wasteful!! It is not being able to have a zero sugar soda without having to worry about buy them in a grocery order and taking up space. These taste just fine and were received in perfect condition.
Sterling M. Smith,5-Jun-23,1,"The first thing I noticed after mixing this according to the instructions was to grab the bottle and take a second look. I was certain I had ordered regular Pepsi -- Not Diet Pepsi.And, I was right, it didn't say ""Diet Pepsi"", yet why did it have that weird aftertaste like diet sweeteners that almost makes your eyeballs hurt?Sure enough, after I looked at the ingredients, I found the culprit:SUCRALOSE -- why, why, why?I've been to restaurants and ordered a fountain Pepsi that had the same flavor a few times. Not all the time, but every once in a while, I get one where I have to send it back. You can usually tell by the amount of foamy/fizzy -- Diet Pepsi foams *much* less than regular, which causes it to look darker in the cup.My guess is that some cheaper formula syrup is marketed by Pepsi for those places because it's just cheaper to produce with replacing some of the sugar with Sucralose -- and I'm also guessing that just enough people don't notice it or care about the artificial taste that they can get away with it.Depending on the specific drink or food, I might not notice it as much, but I can definitely taste it in Pepsi -- because I know what to expect and getting that bitter-sweet smack in the face that I get from the Sucralose makes it that much worse because I taste it with *every* sip, and cringe.I tried adding sugar and some light corn-syrup to mask the annoying Sucralose taste, but it's still there -- so that didn't mask it.I had read that adding salt to coffee will reduce the bitterness -- and that does work for coffee.But the Sucralose isn't so much a bitter taste as an acrid or ""false"" taste sensation that I can detect. Because I had bought the 4-pack and didn't want to waste it, I tried adding all of these:Torani Cinnamon SyrupLemon JuiceCherry flavoringSaltTorani Salted Caramel Syrup - (the worst, btw).Nothing worked to offset the taste.There aren't any other Pepsi-brand options that are made for the smaller home soda-machines, unless you want to by a 3-gallon box of syrup for about $150 that is made for restaurants and way overpricedI'm almost tempted to buy it, but then what if it's the same nasty sucralose formula as this product? I'd be out $150 and have 3 gallons of syrup to dump.The bottle says ""Special Soda Stream only formula"" -- which means ""We cut corners on this to save a few bucks and cut down on the shipping weight.""This is a terrible excuse for the regular Pepsi formula. If you like Diet Pepsi, then this might work, but then you'd still have the sugar. If you don't have sensitive taste-buds, then maybe this would be okay for you.But if you don't like the nasty aftertaste of Sucralose (Splenda-brand-name), then stay away from this. There are others that might not be exactly Pepsi, but Pepsi-with-Splenda is worse than any other cola that doesn't use artificial sweeteners.So, lesson learned. I'll be checking the ingredients when I buy pre-made syrups.Don't get me wrong, I really like Pepsi with sugar and even with the high-fructose-corn-syrup. I don't like Diet Pepsi -- even though I have friends who say, ""You get used to it."" -- buy why? Why would I want to do that when the real stuff exists for the same price?Overall, only one-star because zero-stars are not possible."
Public Profile Name,13-Apr-24,5,"These are delicious. I think they taste better than bottled Diet Pepsi. They use a different sweetener from aspartame so if your friends won't shut up about how bad aspartame supposedly is for you because you drink diet soda non-stop, these will help you cull your exposure."
S. Moon,10-Feb-24,4,"So I hate diet sodas because of the after taste. I can't even drink coke zero. When I first had this, I've only had it for two day, I did not like it. To get over the after taste I had diet coke, which I haven't had in a long time, and knowing how bad the after taste is on diet sodas makes this tolerable. Doing the math the price I bought this at is less than 1/4 the cost of Pepsi in the stores, it makes less waste, and I don't need to go to the store just to buy soda when I want to watch a movie.I don't make it like the directions, I add a little less syrup, I think that negates some of the after taste. I also don't use a soda stream to make it. I use Fizzpod because I can put the flavor in before carbonating. I have a soda stream but the problem is when you add the syrup that takes away a ton of the fizz. If you put in the syrup before carbonating the carbonation is stronger. It also makes less of a mess. Fizzpod machines have the part that goes into the soda as the lid so it can be thoroughly cleaned, don't try this on a soda stream or you need to take the whole thing apart to wash it.Overall I think it is well worth it, it's cheaper, more convenient, at ton less waste, basically saving 4 two liter bottles and a one liter bottle. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the after taste. I'd say maybe it is the bottle of syrup I got but I also got some Starry Lemon Lime and it has the same after taste so I don't think when I get to my next bottle of Pepsi Syrup it will be any different.I'd say if you have a Soda Stream or competitor carbonation machine it is worth a shot but I wouldn't go out and buy a machine just for this. Most of what I drink is straight carbonated water, this is just a treat for me."
Cathy Johnson,8-Apr-24,5,I purchased a SodaStream at my church's garage sale and tried to use it. I definitely did NOT like the taste of the drink flavors that came with it. Then I went to my niece's house and they had the Pepsi mix. I tried it and it was delicious! So I ordered some of my own and now make my own soft drink. Will be ordering again when this supply runs out.
Jim Mellenberger,13-Mar-24,4,"I purchased an Ultima Cosa carbonating package a couple of months back, trying to cut my soda costs, and eliminate my Aspartame intake as much as possible. I initially bought SodaStream Diet Cola mix, which was pretty good, then tried this 4 pack of Diet Pepsi mix.4.5 stars, it has Diet Pepsi taste, maybe a little less carbonation than factory-made soda, but it works for me. I like the experience so far, so I expect I'll order more, maybe even subscribe after I get a baseline, which saves a few cents per bottle on orders.Good product!"
grush,18-Apr-24,4,"Tastes good, but very expensive for what you get."
Ed Tisoncik,9-Apr-24,4,"Very close to original, much better than Starry Zero. Pricing better than OME."
Amazon Customer,13-Mar-24,4,"They taste good but have a harder time staying carbonated compared to ones we bought at the grocery store. I have no clue why.If you mind your drinks being more ""flat"" than usual, then you'll be left wanting. I'm fine with it but my husband won't drink them."
Amanda Mattocks,11-Apr-24,5,I love making my diet Pepsi at home and helping to reduce plastic waste. I get the best deal here on Amazon too!
Steve,9-Apr-24,5,It's good I like it easy to make switched cuz grocery store no longer had four for $5 2 l
TechnoGeek,22-Mar-24,4,Slightly less flavor than you get in the companydirect sodas. I add a splash of cherry concentrateto give added zest.
Steven Bressler,27-Mar-24,4,Only the taste is off a little bit worth buying. Will but again.
Aloha 6,17-Mar-24,4,Actually tastes like a pepsi zero. 1000x better than the generic sodastream stuff that tastes like the worst generic 99¢ store cola you could possibly find.
Joe Momma,17-Feb-24,4,I bought the soda stream when I saw this available. It lists sugar as the main ingredient but it tastes a lot like artificial sweetener and a little flat regardless of the amount of bubbles. I tried the grape and lemon lime that came with it and they taste like the flavored water you purchase. I tried it with real grape juice and it's pretty good. Disappointed with the Pepsi flavor.
CRockstead,18-Apr-24,5,Great deal!
kdj,26-Feb-24,4,Others said it was just like diet Pepsi I think it had that Soda Srteam flavor not bad but it stands a lone. If you're like my wife and drink only Diet Pepsi it won't work. If you're open to a little twist on the flavor it's ok.
rael salas,5-Apr-24,5,"good taste, as long as u use cold water. definitively would buy it again."
Charles Tiffany,10-Apr-24,5,It’s just like 7up.
Texasowl,28-Mar-24,5,Taste almost as the factory made. Read the instructions on the side of the syrup bottle.
Erica ,23-Feb-24,5,"I don't have a Soda Stream, I have something similar from another company (sparkle) but they don't sell soda syrups. I purchased these, hoping it would taste like fountain diet Pepsi and it does! I much prefer the taste of fountain drinks to canned or bottled. These are simple to use and it's easy to measure the correct amount since it has a 'fill line' in the cap. It lasts a decent amount of time, calculating the cost of everything it comes out cheaper than purchasing bottled soda and tastes better too."
H.Woody,9-Apr-24,5,pricy
Amazon Customer,6-Apr-24,5,Product has a good cola taste.
Amazon Customer,28-Feb-24,4,"Without the artificial flavor. If you squeeze a little fresh lemon in it, it's soooo good.It would be nice to offer a variety pack with different flavors."
Sean,28-Feb-24,4,Taste more like RC cola than Pepsi but it’s good especially for the price and ability to make it the way O want to.
tfmd,23-Mar-24,5,"Looks, like and tastes like Diet Pepsi. That's what I expected so what more can I say?"
Yifan Tian,31-Jan-24,5,"I've been using the SodaStream Zero Sugar Water Enhancer for a few weeks now, and it has completely transformed my water drinking experience. As someone who struggles to stay hydrated because I find plain water uninteresting, this enhancer has been a game-changer. The flavors are vibrant and delicious without being overpowering, and the fact that it's zero sugar is a huge plus for me. It's super easy to use with my SodaStream machine, adding just the right amount of fizz and flavor to make drinking water more enjoyable. I also love that a little goes a long way, making it cost-effective. It's a healthier alternative to sugary sodas and juices, and I feel good about incorporating it into my daily routine. Definitely a must-try for those looking to jazz up their water intake!"
Matt Peterson,28-Feb-24,5,"SodaStream® Starry® Zero Sugar Beverage Mix has earned its place as my go-to choice for a light and refreshing sparkling drink. Its excellent taste, versatility, and health-conscious attributes make it a standout option for those seeking a guilt-free soda experience. I highly recommend this beverage mix for SodaStream enthusiasts and anyone looking to elevate their sparkling drink game without compromising on flavor or health."
Joseph Negaard,26-Mar-24,5,Tastes almost like real fountain soda. It goes a long way and definitely saves money.
Brittney Foster,6-Mar-24,5,"So we love making our Orange sodas and they actually come out tasting much better. We still find our self for convenience, sake buying cans and either bottles. However, this is nice for when we run out and still want a soda. and these really do taste like the real thing"
Anthony M,19-Feb-24,4,Maybe maybe not. I do like a good soda once in awhile. Definitely more of a Pepsi zero aftertaste but otherwise it fires the synapses.
Jo,3-Apr-24,5,It tastes great.
Pamela Beischer,20-Mar-24,5,We bought our son a soda stream for his birthday and we’re so excited to find they make a Pepsi one!
TheMaster,15-Feb-24,4,The taste is slightly off no matter what I do in terms of mixing it. Not horrible but not the same as getting it out of a bottle.
Joel,29-Feb-24,4,"Almost as good, but a little off. Afficionados won't like it."
Dwight H.,15-Mar-24,5,I love the convenience of adding STARRY to my soda stream while still getting the same great flavor. It's a fantastic value for me.
Stephen Nelson,16-Mar-24,5,I thought this was a great deal. 4 bottles for a set price. We are giving the SodaStream another try.Thanks.
Taste just like restaurant Pepsi. Right out of the fountain.,1-Apr-24,5,Delicious
Sharon L.,22-Mar-24,5,Perfect alternative that saves money. Waiting for Mt Dew Zero!
T. C. Parker,29-Mar-24,5,Soda stream
Amazon Customer,21-Mar-24,5,Real pepsi taste no compromise in taste
alen blesic,17-Mar-24,5,My kids love it and I can control how sweet I make it
Camarillo,28-Feb-24,5,I love this product! It tastes great and I don't have to lug around heavy soda's from the store. It is so easy to use and saves us money and time. I would recommend this product.
John Nazz Jr.,3-Mar-24,5,"Taste great. You just have to get the correct measure. I’m really like the taste, it tastes just like the bottle or can for me."
Kelli,19-Nov-23,4,"I've adjusted the syrup to the exact taste that I like, but I cannot get the right carbonation. The directions recommend 5 pumps. I'm up to 15 pumps on a new canister! And then it goes flat 1/2 way to the end of the liter. I recently bought 1/2 liters to see if it would retain the carbonation, and it helps. Not sure how to make the carbonation last longer. I bought this to save on sodas and to save on disposing plastic. Jury is still out, but as of now, I will keep it a 4-star rating.I'm also looking for cheaper alternatives to non-caffeinated syrups for evening drinks."
Jim Bailey,13-Mar-24,5,"Very Good Flavor, bought a 4 Pack so it would last me."
The Valuable Opinion,13-Dec-23,5,"I absolutely love using the SodaStream® Pepsi® Beverage Mix (440ml, Pack of 4)! Initially, I was skeptical, but this product has exceeded my expectations. It offers a Pepsi flavor that, in my opinion, surpasses those from restaurants or pre-bottled options. The best part is the customization aspect – you can blend it with other flavors or adjust the intensity to create your own personalized Pepsi experience.Following the instructions for measuring out the syrup is key, as I learned from my first enthusiastic attempt. The dopamine rush from going a bit overboard the first time has only piqued my interest even more. The ability to experiment with flavors and intensity levels has made my SodaStream experience not only enjoyable but also a creative endeavor.In conclusion, if you're a fan of Pepsi and enjoy a customizable soda experience, the SodaStream® Pepsi® Beverage Mix is a fantastic choice. I wholeheartedly recommend it for its superior taste, versatility, and the sheer fun of creating your own soda concoctions."
Suzanne S,21-Dec-23,4,"I find 28oz of water heavy fizz with mix up to the first lines works best. Middle line like the instructions say is too sweet, it’s too much.I ordered again when there was a sale and received a spoiled batch which wasn’t even close to the expiration date on the bottles. Called soda stream and they sent me a replacement fast."
Julia Wermuth,17-Jan-24,4,It's ok but it taste like half diet pepsi. My kids and husband don't seem to mind tho. Not sure why they put sucroslose in it! 
Raginrican,1-Feb-24,4,"The Diet Pepsi is fantastic! The Lemon lime flavor is absolutely disgusting, just a terrible after taste."
Benjamin Vincent,8-Mar-24,5,You have a soda stream and miss your Pepsi then order this now!
BH,9-Jan-24,5,"I drink a lot of soda, it's my guilty pleasure. But with the cost of groceries and recycling all those 2 liter bottles I thought this might be a good option. Never cared much for the sodastream ""cola"" flavor so gave this a shot. Here's what I did. I had 2 liters already of pepsi zero, poured over ice then made some of this in my sodastream and poured that over ice. I really wanted to do a blind test so literally closed my eyes and just tasted them both, couldn't tell the difference. Mind you, some of you may have different preferences but I'm happy to have less waste, save $ and still get my soda fix! Now we just need a coke zero sodastream flavor to come out! hahaha"
Matthew C. Bayer,29-Feb-24,5,"Tastes like real fountain Pepsi, with the ability to make it a little more or less sweet."
Michael H.,19-Jan-24,4,Not badMixed with carbonated water.Added cinnamon sugarSaved the plastic bottles for camping
Colby Conyers,20-Dec-23,4,Tastes pretty dang close to real Pepsi and with fewer calories. Of course you have to have a soda stream or some form of carbonated water and something is just a tad off about the taste. Although we prefer it way more to bottled.
Sean,24-Feb-24,5,"There's a slight aftertaste that's different from the real thing, but making it at home, kids don't notice it and think it's homemade Pepsi and Starry."
a.k,22-Nov-23,4,"The product came quickly and at a good price. The Pepsi tasted good but the starry was off-putting. I'm not 100% sure why there is aspartame in them when they are not diet but majority of soda stream products seem to have this. Could be why the starry wasn't so good. Overall I personally would buy the Pepsi again but not the starry, however for someone who has not tried either flavor this is a great package to try out."
Chris,15-Dec-23,4,It lacks the acidity and it’s WAAAAAAAYYY sweeter and more strongly flavored than the canned/bottled stuff.I’ve found that a bit less than halfway between the lines for half a liter and less sweet liter is the sweet spot.
chipper flynnn,8-Jan-24,4,A little to much or to little makes a big difference. When you get it right it's pepsi
Alex Soper,11-Mar-24,3,"First off - I am a BIG fan of my SodaStream! I have been using it for a little over a year. I have never purchased soda flavored addictive before, so these were new to me. As someone who drinks 2 Pepsis a day, I figured I would give this a try. There is definitely a flavor difference between using the concentrate and canned/bottled Pepsi. The difference is enough to know, but it's not that it tastes bad. I won't purchase again, but glad I don't have to wonder any longer."
Runion,2-Jul-23,5,"SodaStream Pepsi Beverage Mix (440ml, Pack of 6)Its about time I like Pepsi. I will drink Coke in a pinch but I prefer Pepsi.With things starting to cost more than the national debt, we are looking for ways tocut the costs.Pepsi bought Soda Stream some time back but had only sold the Soda Stream Pepsi to othercountries with the promise to sell in the US. Our TIME HAS COME ! ! ! ! ! !I will start with Soda Stream Pepsi tastes a lot like the Pepsi we buy in cans, but not exactly.I think its the sweetner that leaves that taste difference. But nothing you cannot get used to.SO, the pepsi comes in pretty much stock Soda Stream containers, only Pepsi has packaged themin clear plastic rather than the normal white containers.Same measuring caps.If you do not use the Soda Stream system, you can mix a measured cap of syrup to seltzer water. I think the measure is one portion of syrup to 6 portions of seltzer water. I keep changing the portions, trying to get the same taste I get from the cans, almost got it but no prize yet.Quality seems the same as other Soda Stream system syrups.Very happy that Pepsi has finally come out with the syrup version for Soda Stream.RECOMMENDED, absolutelyI do not know the seller nor did I get any money or product for my random review230702 1238"
John R Andres,20-Dec-23,4,The flavor is not bad to me it tastes like pespi zero It would be a matter of taste everybody has different tastes
Elizabeth,2-Mar-24,5,Exactly as described. Very happy
Joshua,13-Sep-23,3,"I ordered these because it was the most cost effective option closest to what I normally get (the Dr. Pete flavor being my favorite) since it had a really good price for a four pack of these. Dr. Pepper is ok and I do kind of like it in general, but these seem a bit off. There is a sort of sharpness to the smell and the taste is just a tiny bit off. It's still drinkable and it's not making me sick or anything, but it definitely does not taste at all like a real Pepsi. And I don't mean that I have too much or not enough as it tastes off, not weak or strong. A slight hint of a sourness or something. Still kind of ok if cold enough -- not actually bad -- but only just barely ok-ish, not actually good.It is possible that these were just stored badly or something. Too much heat perhaps? That certainly has been an issue this year. Unfortunately, this is a four pack, so even if I was inclined to keep buying more to try I wouldn't be doing so for a while (hopefully I can get more Dr. Pete by then though instead.) Still, I consider this to be an accurate thing to bear in mind even if so because that means it's going to be like this in many batches."
RNCrawford,11-Jul-23,4,"I gave up colas a while back and just used my Sodastream for sparkling water with lemon or lime crystals. Then I ran across the Pepsi and Coke Zeros and that old itch had to be scratched all over again. If you like the flavor of either, this is right on the nose provided you dial in how much syrup you make use of. A little experimentation will land you in that ""sweet spot"" as it were.As to price though, that depends on who the seller is. A little while ago the supply on Amazon got tight, and some sellers jumped on the opportunity to pump their margins. I didn't mind that much, I just voted with my wallet and waited for the supply chain to refresh, so word to the wise, look at your seller options and don't just bang that ""BUY"" button without a look."
glen proud,25-Feb-24,5,I like the flavor. I was a good price.
PPruitt,29-Jan-24,5,"My husband can't tell the difference. In my area a 2lt bottle of Pepsi Zero is $2. Buying these on Subscribe and save it will work out to .47 cents per liter. You do have to factor in the cost of CO2, but we have bulk tanks, so that is cheaper also."
Len,29-Feb-24,5,Tastes the same as buying anywhere else.
djmsn,23-Feb-24,5,Bought it for my son and he says it tastes like regular Pepsi to him.
Sigman,28-Feb-24,5,I’ve tried other cola concentrates. This is the best.
Charles E. Bohall III,11-Jan-24,5,"I recently purchased a new Sodastream for the family christmas gift, and picked up the Pepsi mix for my kids and their friends. I regularly host game nights every other weekend, and was spending a lot on beverages for the party. So, I was looking for a way to reduce cost while still providing the drinks they like. All the kids love the tast of this Pepsi mix. Thus, I will be purchasing this for my gaming parties going forward. 10/10, would recommend"
Laura lee J,26-Feb-24,5,Tastes exactly like Pepsi zero.
Ann W. Christie,24-Feb-24,5,Kids love this and easy for them to use
66Merl,4-Jan-24,4,As advertised
luan ruesink,20-Feb-24,5,Fantastic product! Taste is just like the bottled or canned kind
antwonStark,11-Sep-23,4,"Although these have a pretty decent taste, especially for what we’re looking for it is not exactly what I was hoping for. Once I saw this, I was super excited because I know a lot of the Coca-Cola brands got removed long ago. So I was very excited to see a name brand therapy.I will say this does taste like the Pepsi we love, but it doesn’t exactly taste like it. It still has that typical soda stream type flavor.Although it’s not exactly what I wanted, it is still better than most of the other flavors you can buy for the soda stream"
K. Taylor,19-Oct-23,5,"We have had a SodaStream for over 3 years now and have always enjoyed it. When Covid-19 hit and started causing all the supply chain issues and shortages, we pretty much stopped using it, plus at that time the diet cola flavor wasn't that great. Roll forward to better times now and they actually have Diet Pepsi flavor.I really enjoy it. While I don't think it's as great as Diet Pepsi from a can, it's a great alternative and practical to boot since we've got the machine and CO2 again. I play around with the syrup level as I haven't quite nailed the best ratio yet, but again, it's not bad.I did make this purchase solely because it was a Prime Event special pricing and will shop the price for my next purchases, but overall, I like it and will continue to buy it."
Brad Kempeny,18-Jan-24,5,"When mixed as directed this tastes just like Diet Pepsi as it should, I assume the syrup is the same. One caveat has more to do with Sodastream in general- the measuring line. Why do they put three different lines on the top cap? It says to use the middle line explicitly but for some reason that line is the faintest to see."
pacaBill,9-Feb-24,3,"The value for the four-pack is pretty good. The Starry flavor is close to the commercial product. Unfortunately, the Pepsi Zero flavor is a bit off from the commercial product. It's not bad if you want to make your own Pepsi, so it's close, but not exact. Easy to use, although the fill mark in the bottle cap could be better for the proper amount to use."
Marilyn,14-Jan-24,5,I was trying to buy coke syrup but I couldn’t get it anywhere. I bought the Pepsi and use it for my recipe and it came out delicious. We had visited a restaurant and had ribs that were so good and I asked the chef if I could have the recipe and gave it to me. It included Coke syrup.
Patrick,2-Mar-24,3,"If this was just sold as a cola, I would rate it higher, but this stuff is sweetened with both sugar and a substitute. It just doesn’t taste like Pepsi, and I can’t believe they are letting Sodastream use their name for this product."
Timothy Pickerill,2-Oct-23,3,"I got the pack with the regulars Pepsi and Starry. Haven't tried the Starry and I haven't had store bought so I can't compare. I bought for the Pepsi and was excited.The Pepsi smells and tastes like Pepsi at first pass, but like all the Soda Stream syrups it give way to the artificial sweetener after taste. This doesn't bother some people, and they don't even notice it. Unfortunately for me, I can taste an artificial sweetener a mile away and they all leave a chemically bitter aftertaste. Which is why my Sodastream was relegated to just making club soda until I saw they had Pepsi. All the syrups are gross to me, like I just chewed a flavored Alka-Seltzer.The Pepsi is no different. The regular Pepsi still has Sucralose in it. Why? No idea. The first ingredient is still sugar. If you aren't bothered by or can't taste sucralose AND you like Pepsi, this will be just fine for you. But for those of us that can taste it and don't like it, you'll be disappointed after you swallow it."
Gunnar Vogtmann,1-Oct-23,4,Am pleased with the flavor. Making it from scratch allows us to make it more bubbly and with a pinch more syrup more potent than bottled or canned Diet Pepsi. Has the same taste as store bought as well. The use by date is a year away. 4 Stars.
Catherine Bennett,6-Feb-24,5,I am hooked and love having a crisp Pepsi whenever I want. Cant wait to try the Mtn. Dew next.
john hathaway,21-Feb-24,5,Great taste
K. Lu,28-Mar-24,3,"It tastes fine, but it is not traditional Pepsi."
Andy Gray,8-Jan-24,3,"Let me preface this by saying I love both SodaStream and Pepsi - but seperately. I say these and thought it was a perfect match for me.I mixed it just like I normally do the Cola flavor and it tastes a little bit like Pepsi. Certainly not a perfect match. but my issue is in more of the price. I don't think the aaditional cost between this and the normal Cola is warranted. It's not demonstrively that much better or worth it in my opinion.If you like the normal Cola flavor, stick with that. You won't be missing anything."
Jfrank,1-Feb-24,5,Used this to reduce my sugar. Taste excellent. Strength very good. a tablespoon with 16b oz of fuzzy water makes a nice afternoon drink
Alyson,1-Feb-24,5,Love this product for my soda stream. Saves time and is more eco friendly than single serve bottles or cans. Easy to have on reorder
Benjamin,31-Jan-24,5,Pepsi Zero mix is basically perfect. All the zero-cal Pepsi I want with none of the plastic or aluminum waste. Savin the planet and delicious Pepsi!
Brooke ,11-Feb-24,5,Tastes just like a fresh pepsi zero
Chris,26-May-23,4,"Unfortunately, the syrup has a diet aftertaste. Even then, it doesn’t taste like regular Starry. Using less syrup than what is recommended and the max level carbonation makes it more enjoyable. Hopefully I’ll get use to the flavor, otherwise I don’t plan on purchasing more of this flavor.*editI tried using the lowest (first line) measurement of the syrup, and the results were much better. It’s still not regular Starry and has a slight aftertaste from the artificial sweetener, but it’s enjoyable now. Try this, or even less syrup, if you are disappointed in the taste. I added a star back to the rating."
Russell S.,25-Jan-24,5,We're able to make our own soda as we need it. Eliminates having cans in the fridge taking up space.Tastes great.
Rush is a band,27-Jan-24,3,I find no real difference between the regular Pepsi syrup and the regular soda stream cola syrup. There’s artificial sweeteners to lower the calories but it affects the taste greatly.This is for others who might be curious about trying the “Pepsi“ labeled soda stream syrup. It’s not worth the extra dollar per bottle.
Mary Love,11-Apr-24,5,"I, personally, LOVE this product. It reminds me of Dr. Pepper to the 5th power or, for lack of a better term, ham glaze. It reminds me of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger ale cooked to a concentrated form. Then, once it cooled, cold water was added and refrigerated. I really wish that the zero sugar product was available because it is extremely sweet. However, I simply add equal parts of water to it and it's just fine."
KMS,3-Mar-24,4,"When I bought and tried this product I really enjoyed the additional raspberry flavor. The only suggestions I would offer, and the two things that would make me consume it regularly, would be to reduce the sweeteners in it and increase the carbonation, please!"
Sherry,14-Apr-24,5,I will buy this until it’s not solid anymore. Has a slight raspberry flavor. Love it alone or with rum. A “spiced” flavorful rum and coke!
Jesskuh ,10-Apr-24,3,Not to my taste. I like trying new and different flavor combos but this wasn't for me.
Keith Minard,9-Mar-24,1,"If you’ve ever had coke from a fountain dispenser that is low on carbonation and the mix is set too high and it’s overly sweet, that is what this stuff tastes like. Awful. I guess this is just a way for them to resell flat over-sweetened stale coke. Drank one half of a can and threw the rest of the cans away. Not even worth the wasted storage space to keep the unused drinks. Add some mild carbonation to berry-flavored cough syrup like Vic’s Formula 44 and that’s what this tastes like. Yuck!"
"Alec A. Kim, MD",17-Apr-24,5,Coke is Coke!Decent price. No need to lug it from the supermarket.Fast shipment.
Judith,12-Apr-24,2,"I bought a 10 pack of this Coke Spiced for work. We all tried it for fun. Of course, since I was the one who paid for it, I was the one who didn't like it. I didn't despise it, but would not buy it again. Back to real Coke original for me. Five people thought it was good. One person absolutely loves it, and says she will be buying this for home from now on.It has a raspberry taste, which to me seems artificial, but others like it. To me, it's too sweet and doesn't have the sharp bite regular Coke has. It might appeal more to Pepsi drinkers who like cola sweeter than us devoted Coke drinkers."
Courtney Forbes,5-Mar-24,4,"It's worth a try once, but I don't know if I'll buy it again."
Donna Geil,8-Apr-24,5,I was shocked at the taste but then I started loving it!
NW,10-Mar-24,5,"I was skeptical after reading the mixed reviews, but thought I'd be adventurous and give it a try. Both my spouse and I ended up really enjoying it. The mix of raspberry plus spice gives this a unique and lively flavor. We'll very likely be buying this again."
Maryann,8-Mar-24,2,I WAS VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PRODUCT ALMOST TO THE POINT OF EXCITEMENT. OUR GROCERY STORES WHERE I'M LOCATED DO NOT CARRY THE SPICE COKE AS OF THIS WRITING SO I ORDERED FROM AMAZON. IT'S ALL A MATTER OF TASTE PREFERENCE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL BUT THIS WAS NOT FOR ME. ORIGINAL COKE IS MY MOST FAVORITE SODA---SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S THE ONLY SODA I PURCHASE. THE CARBONATION ON THE SPICE COKE SEEMED A BIT WEAK TO ME AND IT WAS A BIT TOO SWEET. YOU DEFINATELY TASTE THE RASPBERRY BUT THERE'S A SOMEWHAT AFTER TASTE I'M DON'T CARE FOR. THE PRICE OF $6.34 FROM THE SELLER IS A VERY GOOD PRICE. IT WAS DELIVERED VIA UPS IN 2 DAYS AS PROMISED BY AMAZON AND PACKAGED WELL
Todd G,2-Mar-24,5,Right size taste great or should I say amazing will buy again sooner than later
John,26-Feb-24,5,Has an identity now.
Yaniri,14-Apr-24,2,Was looking forward to these but it does taste like cherry medicine and the aftertaste is not good. Should’ve read the reviews.
Amil Dave,25-Mar-24,2,"Sadly, the raspberry flavor overshadows the spice. In fact, this should just be called ""Raspberry Coke""."
Chloeish,6-Mar-24,2,Maybe for a cocktail but not for sippin.
Kindle Customer,4-Apr-24,1,The took coke and added.....nasty smelling and tasting perfume. Gross 
Janice wasinger,15-Mar-24,1,I tasted and tossed it. Wasn’t worth the wait!
Rayne,29-Mar-24,1,It was awful.
"Case, from Space",2-Apr-24,4,"I don't drink a lot of soda, so I appreciate these smaller cans. The ""Spiced"" flavor seems like a mix of different fruity colas, which may appeal to some. I found it to be a little too syrupy for my taste. It might mix well with a hard liquor, but I haven't had the occasion to try that yet. I did find that it tasted better to me over ice."
Haley,10-Mar-24,3,"This flavor is pretty polarizing. I haven’t seen anything positive about it on social media, I go to the store and it’s always fully stocked, and the person who I let try it said it was “the worst thing I’ve ever tasted.” He’s probably exaggerating. I think some people taste a strong coughsyrup flavor that really turns them off of this. To me it’s a light cherry flavor with a little bit of spice and creaminess. It also kind of tastes flat in a way. I like it. I’m not crazy about it but it’s not the worst thing I’ve ever tasted by any means. Where I’m tempted to complain is about how much product you get for the price. I found that I might actually prefer these smaller cans as I can finish a drink while it’s still cold, but the price is way too expensive."
LunaFendi,8-Mar-24,3,"If you're a fan of Dr. Pepper, then you might enjoy Coca-Cola's Spiced flavor. It has a similar blend of flavors, with a slight hint of cinnamon and other spices. However, for me, it felt like I was just drinking a cheaper less carbonated version of Dr. Pepper. I was quite disappointed. It tasted more like cough medicine than anything else. However, the worst part was the aftertaste - it was reminiscent of prune juice and very unpleasant. I definitely did not enjoy the drink at all. The high sugar content was also a major drawback for me. Instead, I will stick to my preferred choice of infused water with my enchanter pitcher, which not only tastes better but is also better for my health. I am not a fan of overly sweet or artificial-tasting drinks. That's why I usually opt for water or lightly flavored beverages. However, when I do want to indulge, I prefer drinks that have natural ingredients and a more subtle taste. Unfortunately, this soda did not meet my standards."
keith howard,8-Apr-24,3,"When you drink it chilled, it tastes fine. But lukewarm it gives the strangest aftertaste like cough medicine."
Jake,19-Mar-24,3,"Cans were new and fresh but flavor of this is pretty unappealing... I think raspberry by itself would work well but the spiced part of it throws me off a bit just not a fan. I don't like sodas from certain Drs, so was not sure how I would like this, and it just didn't hit the mark. If you like sodas from Drs perhaps this is one to try.Seems to be rather polarizing, love it or hate it. I hated."
WhiskeyJack,7-Mar-24,4,"If you've ever got a fountain pop and had various flavor adders where one of them was raspberry, well this is that as it tastes like a coke fountain pop with a raspberry flavor shot. Coke flavor with a light but pronounced candy like fake raspberry flavor. It says spiced, but I just really taste that raspberry flavor shot. It tastes good to me and of the many selections of flavor shots, raspberry is one of them that I will select. Not for everybody but good enough for me."
Allblessed,12-Mar-24,4,"We are sugar conscious here and each mini can contains about 50 grams, including the added amount. That's a problem for us, so we drink them less often. Regarding the taste, I feel that they are very similar to the original.Many who find the original enjoyable may likely enjoy these as well."
Seamoss,12-Mar-24,4,"I wanted to like this, however the flavor profile to me is not enjoyable. I get a strong raspberry scent but less berry flavor. Taste was kind of medicinal. My 9 year old likes it though!"
Sleepy,10-Mar-24,4,"I haven't drunk coke in a while, so I took a poll on this new flavor. The consensus was that it's a good sweet flavor, kinda like cherry coke, and somewhat similar to Dr. Pepper. I usually don't like drinks with a cherry taste, since I associate them with medicine flavors, but this raspberry coke was sweet without that medicinal taste. I like that the cans are mini sized. It's helpful for portion control. There's enough in this can to satisfy without having to go overboard."
Pawsable,11-Mar-24,4,"So this wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I expected. I don't honestly know what I expected but it wasn't that. This was sweet, had an aftertaste that came on a little after finishing. I would drink it again but I won't go out of my way to get it. However I enjoyed it more than Cherry and Vanilla Coke."
Jasmine,9-Mar-24,4,"this is a very small can about only a sip each can, not a fan of the raseberry flavor as well"
CC,8-Mar-24,4,"I don't really drink coca-cola, but the spiced intrigued me. It doesn't have any spice to it though, and it kind of tastes like a dr pepper to me. I don't taste the raspberry flavor, but it is more sweet tasting to me than anything. This little can as 25g of sugar and corn syrup is the second ingredient after carbonated water. Not quite sure it is called spiced. The flavor isn't bad, but not what I was expecting. I was expecting something more exciting with a kick."
jellybean5922,7-Mar-24,4,This Coca-Cola Spiced is Nice!I like the raspberry and coke flavor of this!Great Value!
"Dinosaurs and Mermaids, mom of both",7-Mar-24,3,"Upon opening a nice cold of this Spiced Cola, I got a good whiff of the ""spice"". It has a unique taste. Not horrible, but just wasn't for me. Now my mom on the other hand, liked it."
Ryan Richard,10-Mar-24,5,"To start off, mine came VERY carbonated, way more than the bottles I get and even cans. The spiced flavor is actually raspberry with hints of cinnamon and I taste something very familiar to chai, so it's not actually like Mexican spices which is what I was thinking but like actual spices! I do agree it's like Dr Pepper with the raspberry flavor. I do think this gets the edge because it has a more clear flavor, it should honestly say raspberry spiced instead of just spiced because the berry is the main part of this coke.Yes, the sugar is high, 25g in a 7oz bottle, it's very carbonized, and it's still Coca-Cola, but if you're a fan of the berry flavored sodas, you're gonna love this, and a lot better than regular soda which I haven't been having recently due to the taste and having healthier drinks nearby, but as a treat once in a while with a meal this is great!"
Webb,7-Apr-24,5,"This is a great new twist on the classic coke. I love the little smaller cans. At 60 cents a can they are reasonably priced.The flavor is interesting. While they focus on the ""Spiced"" element, raspberry is really the dominant flavor.Overall, I'm very happy with the ""Coca-Cola Spiced 7.5oz 10pk""."
D. L.,20-Mar-24,5,The small cans of Coke are great because sometimes I do not want to drink too much sugar and the smaller amount of soda allows me to get my fix without going overboard. This flavor is not for everyone but personally I like it. I find that the flavor is a bit less intense in the smaller cans and doesn't really taste that much different from your regular coke.
C,13-Mar-24,5,"I'm not a big soda fan, but was intrigued by unique flavoring. The raspberry flavor blends with the cola flavor very well, without either one being overpowering. I'm not sure why they went with 'spiced' as the marketing ploy here as there isn't anything (to me) in raspberry that resembles spice, but that's just me. Overall, it's a good coke with underlying raspberry flavors."
Alyssa,9-Mar-24,5,"I did not have any idea what to expect from this, but this box of 10 tiny cans are good for a) trying to cut back your soda intake and b) mixers depending on what the vibe is you're going for. It doesn't taste much like the original flavor as one might expect, but the raspberry and spices do come through and aren't a bad mix at all."
Josue Martinez,22-Mar-24,5,"I really like these cans, they taste festive and delicious"
Honest Reviews,11-Mar-24,5,"I love this version of Coke, it’s spicy and tastes great by itself or used as a mixer. Coke in a can is the best and this new flavor is solid, I prefer original but it’s a good twist"
Rookie Malhotra,10-Mar-24,5,"This coca-cola is super awesome! Here is my list to sum it up!- Came well packed.- Great for many occasions.- Good size.- Very carbonated.- Balanced flavors.- Fruity.- Convenient.- Crisp.- Fresh.- Easy to store.- Good aroma.All in all, this coca-Cola is delicious and unique!"
Eletaronma,8-Mar-24,5,The Coca-Cola Spiced taste great.
J. F.,8-Mar-24,2,"This Coke was weird. Diet soda is my usual and to me this sugar version has calories but very low sweetness to make the calories worth it. The flavors are vague and the mouthfeel seems thinner than it should be. My partner tried it and suggested it would be good with rum, given the spice flavor."
reunited,9-Mar-24,1,"This tastes like a combination of watered down coke, and the contents of your gran's handbag. You know the smell of an old lady's purse? That's what this tastes like, but carbonated. This is the first coke product I've ever tried that I didn't love. As if the taste wasn't awful enough, it has a weird musky/perfume aftertaste with a hint of cigarette smoke.."
Bite Me,2-Mar-24,1,This Spiced coke tasted like cough medicine. It was god awful!
J. Bowshier,28-Feb-24,1,I almost vomited
BLAIRFILM@gmail ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,25-Mar-24,5,"From childhood through adult life and into the latter years (80 plus) there's just nothing that brings me a big smile than this incredible COCA COLA!I think I've tried many, many types of cola drinks over the years, not there's simply no treat better than my favorite thirst quencher for an entire lifetime!Great product and excellent flavor, freshness and very affordable price!I sure hope this helps!"
Shopping V,22-Mar-24,5,"While I prefer to drink either the glass bottled (with cane sugar) or canned version of Coke, as they just tastes slightly better and fresher to me, but I don’t mind drinking the plastic bottle of these “Coca-Cola Soda Soft Drink, 16.9 fl oz, 6 Pack,” once in a while, especially, for the price, which is very reasonable. I don’t always drink sodas, but when I do, I drink Coke as they’re not too sweet and not bland either. Coke also doesn’t tastes bitter to me either, compared to its competitor, Pepsi, which has this slightly bittery taste to them. I love a glass of Coke to go with certain dishes like Pizzas and hamburgers as they enhances the taste of pizza and hamburgers in my opinion. 😍I highly recommend these “Coca-Cola Soda Soft Drink, 16.9 fl oz, 6 Pack” to others, as these are very well-priced and tastes great and refreshing."
beth,15-Apr-24,5,It was a little spicy but it was good. Good with rum also.
Joey,15-Apr-24,5,"I always like buying the bottled over the cans because the flavor is better. At the time of purchase, the price for these was great (better than the store). The quality is the same as buying from the store."
SallyDue,8-Mar-24,5,"Coke is always good anytime you want a cold drink. The bottles fit easily into the refrigerator, and are easy to take along fishing or picnics too. They are great for back yard bar-b-q's. They do not break if dropped and are reusable. We like to freeze wateer in them to put in the coolers. And when they are laid on their sides and a strip cut off the back, the bottles can be used to grow small radishes too. When you have drunk the delicious coke, the bottles are useful in scout projects"
London154,24-Mar-24,4,"I usually don’t drink this brand, but decided to give it a try. The flavor was a little different than anything else, but nothing I would go out of my way to purchase."
Taylorglam55,4-Apr-24,5,"This coke variation is delightful. It has the bite of the Classic Coke with a berry essence and a gentle touch of spice on the back end. The spice is barely there but you can still taste it. I kept some in a thermos overnight with ice and it still had that strong Coke carbonation in the morning. I bought it for $3.98 because that was a great ""try me"" price but now it has gone up three dollars in price! All in all, I did enjoy the flavor better than the vanilla or cherry Coke but nothing beats the original recipe."
Amazon Customer,8-Apr-24,5,Great price. Delivered right to door. Never damaged. Fresh and taste great
CCReader,13-Apr-24,4,"I've never had a drink taste like this before. You can definitely taste there are spices in it and fruit, but it's different.I was hoping it would taste like Dr. Pepper. Nope, not in the slightest. It's worth a try."
Amazon Customer,9-Apr-24,5,"was surprised that -0- bottles had not leaked, each and every bottle had been ripped from the plastic holders, I have no idea how that could have happened--every one was separated."
Amazon Customer,12-Apr-24,5,"I am so glad, you all finally reduced the price, and allowed me to order this product! Miraculous, in our 3rd Heavenly Father and our Master's hand."

Stacey Williams,17-Apr-24,5,As I expected.
Debbie,29-Mar-24,5,I like the price. I like the taste. I like bottled coca-cola better than canned soda pop. Bottled soda pop doesn't lose their fizz.

JS,29-Mar-24,4,"Put this in the fridge, it is better cold. I like Raspberry flavor, I want to try the zero Raspberry. I wish this didn't have any calories."
Mr Chris,19-Mar-24,4,"These cokes taste good and they’re right out of the bottle pretty carbonated, but it just doesn’t seem the same as opening like 12 ounce can of Coke. But I still like them now I’ll re-ordered them so I guess I don’t mind."

Ryan,5-Mar-24,5,Surprisingly delicious! Reminds me of ICEE of wild cherry and blue raspberry mixed together just softer in flavor and add carbonation. Would purchase again. Hope it sticks around
ashley,7-Mar-24,5,I snagged this at a good price. Cheaper than the stores.
Que Choca,2-Mar-24,5,Normally you pay an arm and a leg for delivery of liquids. This is very reasonably priced with free delivery.
Reader515,22-Feb-24,5,"If you loved California raspberry Coca-Cola and missed the taste, well it's back with a little spice to it. I love the flavor, you can smell the raspberries before you even taste it. This is my favorite Coke product, I am so glad it's back...for good!!"
Grant,6-Mar-24,5,Can't beat this.
Edward D Black,12-Mar-24,5,Real good

Amazon Customer,4-Feb-24,5,I really like coke it’s one of my favorite pops to drink
JB,25-Mar-24,3,"It's better to just go to the store! YES its great to deliver to your doorstep. Travel time is not worth it, but a good deal. My PERSONAL favorite experience for optimal flavor and freshness and carbonation is still the aluminum can (in date) in the freezer for about 10minutes!"
Syd Sadowski,4-Jan-24,4,"It’s good, but sad that these are getting more expensiv."
Tommie Roe,16-Mar-24,3,Not impressed sorry coke you missed the mark ! I don’t taste any spice only over sweet coke! By the way I like coke! Wished I could have tasted the cinnamon coke but never got any because I couldn’t find it my town! Not a good idea they should have called it raspberry coke no spiced
Amazon Customer,19-Mar-24,3,It is good but I would buy one or more spiced Coke to see if you like it. Spiced Coke is an acquired taste. My friends like it They agreed with me about this Coke being an acquired taste. It's not for everybody. Our tongues are very subjective.
make sure you🙈,8-Apr-24,3,one more time got it not long using days
kathleen johnson,2-Feb-24,5,Tastes like cola.

A. Nuran,17-Mar-24,3,"It's Coke, but the ""spice"" flavor just doesn't work with the base citrus"
These were listed as postpartum underwear. Which means they would be worn while still bleeding Not ???,10-Mar-24,3,"It looked like regular Coke, so that’s what I was meaning to order not the spiced"
Robert Finley,24-Dec-23,5,We drink a lot of Diet Coke and this is a great price just wish we could buy more and often. Plus it’s delivered to the porch.
nathan19nj,6-Mar-24,3,Doesn't taste terrible. But I won't buy it again. I thought it would have some spiced flavor. Nope

Lelia Tucker,28-Feb-24,3,The product was fine
Matilda Manning,13-Jan-24,5,Refreshing
Kindle Customer,20-Sep-23,4,"I ordered 24 bottles and the majority was fine, but out of 24, 5 of them were flat."
Mary Miller,9-Jan-24,5,Like the taste
Kat Williams,28-Mar-24,2,"I'm a Coke lover. Had I a choice, I would drink Coke as my every meal and refuse food. It is a delicious beverage in general and even the diet and free versions are delectable. I eagerly ordered this Spiced Coke anticipating a homey hint of cinnamon and ginger or perhaps an exotic blend of cardamom and star anise. Instead I got 6 bottles of hog swill. I truly believe the makers of Coke have used carbonated water to clean the old Coke from their processing machines then bottled the remnants with a couple cheap drops of raspberry flavor and caramel coloring. It is vile. 0 stars for me, but 2 for my 11 year old who also found it distasteful but drank it happily because he is never allowed to drink caffienated softdrinks."
Lynn Kostelecky,28-Dec-23,5,Tastes great!
Linda T. I got my fan a few days before the day it first said which is great. The fan works REALLY great. I am very happy with the fan that I got.,16-Sep-23,4,Im happy with it 
David U,21-Oct-23,5,"There's nothing, other than cold water, that is as refreshing as an ice cold bottle of Coca-Cola on a warm day. There's something about the bottle that gives Coke a jolt of refreshness. I suggest trying Coke in a bottle."
skipper44,15-Aug-23,5,"These came fast. If you do the math, you will see that you are getting each drink for much less than you would pay at a retail outlet in a city. I live in Charleston S.C. and it is very expensive here. A 16 ounce Coke here goes for about $2.00. With Amazon Prime, you save on shipping costs and get your product faster. I'm reordering before I run out. I highly recommend this product from this seller. They know customer service!"

BLAIRFILM@gmail ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,29-Jan-24,5,"Nothing in the universe tastes just like Coke. Plenty of value in this pack of ten when you compare to other brands and off brands. And nothing I've ever tried has tasted better than Coca-Cola!Full of flavor, just the right size for over glass with ice, plenty of great carbonation and it lasts longer than most any other soft drink in the world.When I don't feel good or when my back hurts the only relief I get is from peeing a can of this over a glass full of medium ice cubes. I love the crackling of the ice as the cola pours over it and I love that taste so much it's hard to wait for it to calm down and get cooler! I have to take a drink Everytime!I hope this is helpful!"
Rhonda E,20-Mar-24,5,"Since I was in my teens, I have always drank the real Coca Cola. I started buying these 7 1/2 ounce cans. The taste is great. I like cans better than plastic bottles. The glass bottles were the best, but I can’t find them now. These cans are nice since they are a smaller version and stay cold until gone. Thank you Coca Cola for making them. Thank you Amazon for carrying them and delivering them."

H2,20-Mar-24,3,"I purchased this item expecting a full size can of soda. Other than the mention of ounces, the description fails to announce that these are mini soda's. I know I should probably be aware of how many ounces a standard soda can is, so that I don't have to count on the description, but they're literally called ""mini"" for a reason."
Amazon Customer,7-Feb-24,5,i love coke
Carlos,29-Jan-24,5,Delicious and refreshing as always. I like these compact 90 calorie cans.
Tara,29-Jan-24,5,What is there to review! Come is the BEST! Always will be!!
Mtnman,29-Jan-24,5,Awesome deal on a name brand product
t roth,3-Dec-23,5,"I recently purchased a case of Coca-Cola and I have to say, I'm very pleased with my purchase. The soda arrived in perfect condition and tasted just as great as I remember from my childhood. The convenience of being able to have it delivered right to my door is a game-changer and I will definitely be purchasing again in the future. Overall, I highly recommend Coca-Cola and buying it from Amazon!"
Colin Steiger,30-Jan-24,5,Best value on coca-cola
Dianne Foote,22-Jan-24,5,Mom enjoyed it. Have a Coke and a smile 
Denise Edwards,24-Mar-24,3,"These sodas were old and were flat. After being refrigerated and cold, these was no buzz or taste of cherry or coke flavor. Has the formula been changed ???"
chris reed,21-Jan-24,5,coke soda original tast nice and its at a cheap price
veronica williams,22-Jan-24,5,The best cola soda ever!
Xuberance60-MD,6-Nov-23,4,"Significant price change in recent times. Just order less often than when I purchased in the past. Oh well, welcome to 2023 and beyond."
Mecca Dawkins,16-Jan-24,5,Great buy. I was worried they would be flat but they never are. I order every month.
PHILLY BOXBOY,14-Sep-23,4,"I thought I was ordering bigger size cans,but Amazon was out of stock on so many soft drinks.The o'der,maybe classic coke.. had a powerful carbonation and a ""smokey"" or hard to explain,almost root beer flavor,this one seems to be a bit watered down,also the regular size 12 oz can was just right to accompany a sandwich or snack,this size always require a second can,a bit sneaky by coke but hey ..."
Linda Dickerson,20-Dec-23,5,"This was one of the easiest shopping experiences I've had in a long time. Shipping super fast, product packaged super well and even a kind note in the package to me. These folks are PERFECT!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!"
debra lou anthony,25-Dec-23,5,This is a great price for 10 cans of mini cokes. Great for those that can't drink a large bottle. Even better for little kids.
Tricia,19-Jan-24,5,Always keep on hand. Great taste as always
TARA M.,20-Jan-24,5,Only flavor of Coke we buy
David Martinez,31-Dec-23,5,I prefer this type of drink over any of the similar taste brands. There is nothing like a cold Coca Cola can on a weekend.
ARC.WSI,23-Jan-24,5,"yummy, that’s all folks"
DHG,14-Jan-24,5,It’s the REAL THING!!! We Love it!!!!
Isabel Vazquez-Carvalho,12-Jan-24,5,Takes the soda craving away in a smaller size
Loretta,13-Jan-24,5,Cute small can love coke

Robert,15-Nov-23,4,Good soda.
Lana,5-Jan-24,5,It never changes

Mamie Jackson,5-Jan-24,5,Thirst quenching for your thirst.
E. Michael Richards,25-Dec-23,5,The perfect size and good value. Prompt delivery.
Brandi Pearl,30-Oct-23,5,"These little cans help me cut down on waste by providing just a little soda at lunch, while taking meds, etc. They are quite portable. They are a reasonable value. I would purchase them again. They arrived in date and in very good condition."
Rachel S.,4-Dec-23,5,"I try to be careful how much soda I drink, especially portion size, so these little cans are great!"
Decorative tree lamp,25-Dec-23,5,Delicious. Crisp. Refreshing.
Emi,27-Jan-24,3,I won't order this again. The coke isn't expired yet. It expires in 8 months but it was somewhat flat. It was much less carbonated than when I buy it at the store.
Bailey Pruitt,11-Dec-23,5,Great quality tasted a lot better than it normally does
linda cullere,13-Dec-23,5,Perfect size and a pretty good price.
Byline by Lynn,3-Dec-23,5,Love the price on Amazon! Substantial savings over buying at the grocery store.
bg,12-Dec-23,5,we love coca cola
Andrea,31-Mar-23,5,"The Coca-Cola 12 Fl Oz pack of 24 is like a party in a box (or should I say, a can). With enough soda to go around, you can invite all your friends over and still have some left for yourself.And the taste? It's like a fizzy explosion of happiness in your mouth. Sweet, refreshing, and just the right amount of carbonation.Plus, the fact that it comes in a pack means you can stock up and never run out (unless you're really popular or have a serious soda addiction).Overall, I highly recommend the Coca-Cola 12 Fl Oz pack of 24. It's the perfect choice for anyone who wants a classic soda that never goes out of style. Trust me, your taste buds (and your guests) will thank you."
Amber,18-Aug-23,5,"Who came up with the idea of cinnamon Coke? Because I appreciate this genius idea from whomever actually did. I can’t even describe how good it was, so I’d just say try it; you will be glad you did. It is a little expensive for what you get, but if you want to give yourself a rare treat, this is the way to do it!"
Bornwithvail,29-Nov-23,5,I love coke I always buy this
Jakobe,2-Aug-18,5,"I live near Atlanta Georgia so having this in the house at all times is required by an unwritten law. We do not say the ""P"" word here.PROS:- It's Delicious.- It's Nostalgic.- It's Best in a can or glass bottle.CONS:- NONE!HOW TO POUR A PERFECT COKE:THE GOAL: Master the art of pouring a Coke from a can into a glass as part life's right of passage.The purpose is to preserve the bubbles from can to glass and here is how to do it perfectly. The secret is ""wet ice"" and a cold Coke.WHAT YOU'LL NEED:- Can of Coke- A tall narrow Glass, not plastic never use plastic.- Good clear cubed ice preferably bagged ice or filtered water ice. Crushed ice, although very tasty isnt reccomended.WHAT TO DO:1. Chill those cans, get them cold.2. Put ice in the glass. TIP: Wet ice is best. Not directly from the freezer that it is so cold your fingers stick to it, but rather cubes that have a wet or shiny appearance. (you can run a little water over them to smooth them up then dump the water out)3. Pop open the can4. Tilt the glass and pour one ounce of Coke over the ice, then wait a few micro moments for the bubbles to briefly settle.5. Keep glass tilted and pour the Coke down the inside of the glass, filling up the glass. Dont just Glug it in there. Go easy and smooth.6. Save about one ounce and pour into middle of glass to give a little head to the foam.Now you have a perfectly poured bubbly and refreshing classic Coke!This method preserves the bubbles and the fresh crisp taste of the Coke from can to glass, the wet ice and slow pour keep as many bubbles as possible."
Mark,24-Nov-23,5,Good price and very good drink highly recommend it
KitKat,6-Dec-23,3,"The item came early, however, when I picked up the package, I could hear the cans rolling around inside the box. When I opened the box, the package had been torn open. So needless to say I won't be drinking from these cans because who knows what was possibly injected in them."
Jennifer Dentremont,29-Oct-23,5,"Love coke! Great soda, great price and great value. Nothing is better than cracking open an fresh Coca Cola"
Fool,27-Nov-23,5,Small cans
Poppa~G,4-Nov-23,5,"HIGH QUALITY, BETTER THAN DESCRIBED, SUPER-FAST SHIPPING, WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!!!"
practical flippery,15-Nov-23,3,"Love these little minis, a household staple. So it was a no brainer to be a subscribe and save, until I saw the amount of packaging. This was not a one off for the packaging excess, I took a couple months of deliveries to decide. Also coke mini's go on sale at the grocery store often, so the slight to no savings is not worth the environmental cost."
Sharon West,10-Nov-23,5,Can’t beat taste of CocaCola!
Amazon Customer,24-Nov-23,5,Quality Goods!!
roxanne medd,3-Jul-23,4,"Product is always good! 4 bulging cans and 2 exploded, had no soda in them !"
George Balsamo,24-Oct-23,5,More than enough for the price

LAD TVL FL,23-Sep-23,5,"Delivery was fast, no negative issues with the delivery, and true product."
johnny adams,18-Sep-23,5,What can I say it's better than Pepsi.
Elle ,24-Aug-23,5,Yes it’s cokeduh it’s goodWhy are you reading reviews for coke you know what it taste like
Amazon Customer,16-Aug-23,5,After beating my dependence to the stuff...I don't like how it dehydrated me....but I LOVE this soda!
Veronica,14-Sep-23,5,Great to pass out on Halloween.
Shorty,11-Jun-23,4,Yummy
Epillon,22-Feb-23,5,"Coca Cola is my go to soda and pretty much the only soda I like. The taste is always refreshing and nothing feels better than an ice cold Coke on a hot day. The delivery was fast and flawless, didn't have any issues with my order. Placed my order and the sodas were on my doorstop within a few hours."
Kara C.,11-May-22,5,Omgoodness if you like cotton candy you will love this is like layers of flavors.... Space flavored is the best way to sum it all up perfect name! To me anyway it's like similar to maybe cherry coke or cherry dr pepper then all of a sudden you get something I can only describe as cotton candy but I feel like saying a powder cotton candy like it's not quite cotton candy but it's amazing like I feel like if I could turn the after taste into a scent it would be an awesome perfume not that the soda tastes like perfume because it does not....look just get the 20 oz like I did then you will rush back to get more
Luvbug,3-Apr-24,5,Flavor is good and refreshing I like it a lot better than the sugar ones good price for the quantity as well
Nicholas,20-Mar-24,5,I'm so addicted to Soda but the calories kill me. Diet just doesn't work for me due to the acrid taste and so I started drinking these Zero Sugar brands! AWESOME! They taste good and are cheaper than most places! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
Damian Reynolds,11-Apr-24,5,Great taste
Crystal Garcia,15-Apr-24,5,Coke Zero is my go to soda daily. These bottles were amazing and fit well in my drink storage in my fridge! Would definitely buy again as they are super convenient!
Anna,15-Apr-24,5,I like the convenience of paying a good price and having it delivered.
Salmon,8-Apr-24,4,"The quantity is just right for a soft drink. Next to tea, this is my favorite soft drink. It is refreshing with Cola taste."
Steven Zack,14-Apr-24,5,Efficient delivery.
Barb Cunningham ,9-Apr-24,5,Tastes great
Rob,1-Apr-24,5,Never had Coke zero before I wanted soda and the price was really good and the taste too.
Girlygirl,29-Mar-24,5,A very nice refreshing taste but I have to use scissors to cut the plastic.
bonniedunlap,29-Mar-24,5,"Love it, was glad to purchase this by amazon."
Laura Mathie,14-Mar-24,5,Best price I’ve seen yet on this product
Amber lauer,6-Mar-24,5,"great deal and fast shipping, just bought 4 more."
LilbitsCreations,22-Feb-24,5,"The title says it all, will not change it, taste is better than I expected. I buy this every time I shop at any store."
mjames467,19-Feb-24,5,Love Coke Zero's drinks. The fact that it doesn't have sugar and empty calories is the sole reason why I drink them.
Minké,30-Jan-24,5,This Coke Zero is absolutely the best! It’s so fresh and exhilarating especially after it’s been chilled. It’s a great price and readily available. Many times the grocery store is out of this particular brand. I buy from Amazon in bulk and it arrives lightning fast. I hope Amazon will maintain this affordable price. Highly recommend 
Jasmine Ihebinike,25-Feb-24,5,Tastes very close to the “real thing “.. I love the flavor
Lynda,13-Feb-24,5,I would like to re order but after the first order it is no longer available. This is the only type of soda I will drink.
Major T,25-Jan-24,4,Zero Sugar seems just a marketing buzz for old Diet Coke; same old stuff with a new name. It is OK.
D. Toney,22-Feb-24,5,I love the taste of Coke Zero. Highly recommended.
Kim,19-Feb-24,5,The order was delivered on as described and I will order again.
KJH,21-Feb-24,5,COKE quality with budget savings
Brianna Brier,29-Jan-24,5,"I’m a huge Coke Zero girly and was happy to see a pack of Coke Zero with such a low and amazing price for a 6 pack. Definitely will be purchasing many, many times again lol."
Mark/Sharon H.,12-Feb-24,5,No Sugar
Emily-Kate,22-Oct-23,5,"So, here's the dealio. I'm no mathematician, but these bottles? Definitely gives off some mini vibes. I mean, I thought I was ordering the grown-up, strutting-its-stuff-on-the-beach size. Turns out, they're more like adorable soda toddlers taking their first steps. Hubby was the one who pointed it out (probably his way of saying I should've read the description better... oops!). Wish they came in 6 packs of 20oz – because, you know, go big or go home! But hey, maybe it's the universe's way of telling my man he doesn't need all that fizz. LOL! Will buy again, but maybe with a magnifying glass next time. 😉"
jessica p.,29-Jan-24,5,My favorite thing to drink tastes great and arrived fast.
Marty,30-Jan-24,5,Good
Irving Steven Sun,25-Jan-24,5,Thank you
Placeholder,16-Jan-24,5,Best diet coke!
New name,14-Feb-24,3,First time i tried zero coke. It no flavour of cocoa. They put too much fake acacia flavour. Too perfume-y I can tell totally different than diet coke.
Peter Barnard,27-Jan-24,3,"To many changes to coca cola over the years imo. I like consistent taste , and this just tasted off to me. Wish they would stop changing sweeteners and labels. Price was great but I had to ""preorder"" for that price and wait 7-10days for delivery, which wasn't a big deal. Bring back TaB 😂"
R.JORDAN,18-Nov-23,5,Still favorite diet drink. Notable that much quantity generates urinary frequency. Perhaps >10 ounces can have that effect. Pepsi Diet is a rival but not the top.
Derek,30-Dec-23,5,Good stuff
Kittenista,12-Apr-24,2,"I am sorry, but this No Sugar Coca Cola tastes more like Diet Pepsi Cola. I know that there are many who prefer Pepsi to Coke and vice versa. I prefer Coke to Pepsi and this No Sugar Coke is more like Pepsi, so I don't like it at all. I prefer the Diet Coke. I would not likely purchase this item again. Maybe it's ""psychological"" but it gives a stomach ache, too. Thank you for letting me express my opinion on this very important subject."
elizaveta protassov,30-Nov-23,5,"Good, good, good"
mymorgy,6-Nov-23,5,I usually am not a soda drinker but boy is this soda delicious and addictive.
Beth Cain,15-Sep-23,5,The only favor of soda I drink. Classic taste. Always fresh.
Mary Miller,28-Aug-23,5,I like when it came on time
Olga L.,20-Aug-23,5,its coke and its good
David Wells,19-Jul-23,5,Great coca cola taste without sugar! If I can't find coke zero I drink water!
lynn,16-Aug-23,5,Liked the taste
gregg lewis,10-May-22,5,"There's no sugar in this; there's no sugar in Coke Zero either. And there's no sugar in Diet Coke. I'm at a loss what to tell you. The flavor is the same as Coke.. yet the lack of sugar also makes it somehow different. What is tricking my brain into thinking it is the coke of my youth I'll leave to forensic scientists to discover. Till then, I will enjoy this new version of the Coke that turned its back on pure cane sugar and walked away to glory and legend just the same."
Lee,25-Jul-23,5,This is my favorite Coca-Cola drink.
m k banks,13-Jul-23,5,Great as always in coke a cola product
Shirley Williams,30-Jun-23,5,I like coke zero
321buhbuy,6-Dec-22,5,"Pleasantly surprised that it actually tasted good to me, better than Diet Coke. I finished every bottle. Would buy again."
Cristina ,4-Nov-22,5,"I absolutely like ! HOWEVER, 90% of the time.....NOT IN STOCK. THIS IS ALMOST EVERY WEEK. SHAME ON WAREHOUSE MANAGER."
Uwohali,22-Aug-22,5,"Really fresh, reasonably priced considering it saved us a trip out using the delivery service."
Nixa Keye,27-Jul-22,5,I loved that they have tasty sugar free options. The kids couldn’t tell the difference…. At all. Until they read the bottle.
Ana Jourdain,12-Oct-20,5,"Great drink but always remember that this has caffeine despite the zero name. My idiot self assumed it didn’t have caffeine because of the name rather than doing research. Turns out it has tons of caffeine. And my anxiety just could not, I didn’t sleep for two nights 😩 had to switch to Diet Coke caffeine free."
Beth,24-Jan-22,5,Greatvtadting. Can't tell that it is nonsugar compared to original.
Bruce Fraser,17-Jan-24,1,I don`t know where all the great reviess came from but it was pretty bad taste. I will go back to diet pepsi and forget this bad leap of faith I tried. live and learnbf
BleuEyes,16-Oct-18,5,We love this Coke Zero! It tastes so close to regular coke without that nasty aftertaste the the Diet Coke has. We had an issue with two bottles out of three six packs being totally flat. I contacted the Coke company and the sent us free product coupons after giving them the codes on the bottles.
Eileen Howorth,5-Sep-21,5,Too much money for what you get. They shrunk the stupid bottle and charge more!
Fast food Cat,17-Mar-24,1,When I get this Coke and only have 12 days left before expires! Disgust this behavior!
Mary Dork,3-Oct-21,5,Bought these for work for my weekly soda drink!
Luigi,13-Feb-21,4,Good flavor.
April,16-Nov-20,5,Coke Zero always seems to be scarce these days. Glad you have it and a great price too.
Ann,5-Feb-22,3,I like regular diet Coke much better than this.
Joe,3-Aug-20,5,I like Coke Zero better than Diet Coke and this is a decent value.
EC,14-Feb-24,1,I did not like the artificial sweetener. Makes my stomach hurt
Carla J,31-Jan-20,5,What can I say? It’s my go to soda. And the price on the Amazon Fresh is really great.
Amazon Shopper,1-Jan-21,5,Great flavor without consuming all that sugar.
deanna k.,6-Sep-21,3,VERY REFRESHING!!
WKT,9-Jan-24,1,Five six-packs ordered. Only three six- packs delivered
ZCW,13-Jan-24,1,Ordered October 22nd..delivered January 9th. Wow
Live Bearded !!,8-May-20,5,Need I say more
Alan,2-Sep-20,5,Love it
SusanB,31-Jan-20,5,Best Coca-Cola product to date
Sandra Tatum,28-Feb-20,3,Flat
Gary Romines,13-May-18,5,Great
TShaw,2-May-21,2,120 calories big deal
Michael A. Mcmahan,2-Apr-21,1,so coke made a smaller bottle at a higher expense instead of useing the 20 oz. bottles just to cut out a little less than 4 oz. Way to expensive for the volume of drink
Tom S.,10-Feb-22,1,Stale no fizz I still have one left after a month or two I don't know if I'm gonna try it
Gene Lariviere,17-Jun-23,5,It taste more like regular Coke compared to its Diet Coke option. They nailed it with the flavor. But I wish they would bring back Coke Zero 2004 time to time. I miss the OG.
Susan Squan,21-Sep-17,1,Please bring back Coke zero. I hate this! I will no longer buy this sweet horrible tasting new coke. I want my cokes zero back please!
LegoGirl,17-Oct-16,5,"I'll drink just about any diet soda, but this is my #1 choice when it's an option. I was a fan of original Diet Coke for year, and was skeptical about this soda when it first came out---I suspected they had simply rebranded the bottle to remove the word ""Diet"" so people would be less self-conscious drinking it. Checking out the ingredients labels of Diet Coke and Coke Zero, things are in a slightly different order there so I guess it's true that the formulations are unique. Coke Zero has less ""bite"" than Diet Coke, so it's probably a better fit for people who like sweeter soft drinks.Note: I can usually find these 6-packs on sale in local groceries for about four bucks; got these with my Amazon Fresh order for a little bit more, still reasonable."
MANISH,4-Dec-16,5,It was great offer to have these many cokes.
Amanda M.,7-Sep-17,2,"I've been a huge fan of Coke Zero since it came out originally. I had almost given up on diet colas as tasting too diet-y, but then I tried Coke Zero and no other diet cola compared to it.This is why I am so saddened to say that the new Coke Zero Sugar just does not compare to it. I tried it, fully expecting it to taste like Coke Zero. I thought, hey, how much of a difference could there be? But no, it's bad. It doesn't taste more like Coke, it tastes more like Diet Coke, and well, I never liked Diet Coke. The Diet taste is extremely strong, and as someone who only drinks diet sodas, you would think that taste would be nearly impossible for me to detect but it's so strong. It tastes like artificial sweetener and badness.Between Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, I have to go with Diet Pepsi because Diet Coke is just not good. (And I always preferred Coke to Pepsi, so that's saying something.)So, now that Coca-Cola has needlessly destroyed Coke Zero and made it taste worse than Diet Coke, I guess I'll switch to Diet Pepsi."
Jimbo,19-Jun-22,5,Coke Zero is the best non sugar cola in the market and the bottles are the perfect size for a hot summer day
Mipp,21-Aug-20,5,I thilrught I was getting reg Coke but zero came ....guess what I Lov it
Jackson,10-Mar-23,5,Nice
CupcakeS,28-Nov-21,5,It tastes great
REMIXX,11-May-22,5,Best low cal. Woke Soda!
Clairekitty,5-Jul-22,5,"Healthy, quick"
Kelly L.,13-Mar-24,5,Great value for this soda.
Valeria,23-Oct-21,5,"I used to drink diet coke and diet pepsi, not crazy about the artificial sweetener aftertaste. I quit them after learning about aspartame's health issues. I didn't know it was still in use till I saw ingredients in both zero coke and zero pepsi, which I've ordered recently, liking the taste. Wouldn't otherwise guess aspartame would be the artificial sweetener of choice in these. Don't know why the taste would be better than the old diet colas. Wish they'd use something not harmful so I can still order colas."
Kirby Taylor,26-Feb-24,5,What I like about this soda is that is sugar free and quenches your thirst and I love it on the market with Amazon as long as there's no recall on it!
Kindle Customer,2-Apr-24,5,They are a great treat but not sold in stores in my state. They are quite pricey but so is everything else. I love the taste
Emad sherif,15-Apr-24,5,All cans came in good condition
Bert,30-Mar-24,5,I liked the flavor. It was for my own use
Janak Katdare,16-Apr-24,4,"Taste good, probably give u cancer but no calories "
Judy Skolnick,1-Apr-24,5,I liked it for a once and a while drink
Yoel Abitboul,11-Mar-24,5,"Finally, it’s coke zero! As we can expect. The little cans are nice to take a little portion during the day"
Amanda Terrell,5-Mar-24,1,The product arrived in a box that was half soaked in soda. The box is almost shredding. The drinks were all covered in soda and had to be washed individually. Two of the cans arrived open and empty.
Todd Smith,4-Apr-24,4,Weird aftertaste and I wonder are these bad for you ?
Kindle Customer,15-Feb-24,4,It tastes a little flat. I don't know if that's Amazon or the Coke Zero. I feel like I remember bottles were more fizzy. But the taste is okay. Enough to take the edge off if you want a Coke but can't have the sugar
Bayo Elizabeth Cary,14-Feb-24,5,"I love diet Coke. However, I avoided caffeine. The smaller Coke Zero portions are ""perfect"" for me. I can have a diet Coke. I can drink the whole can& the caffeine from the smaller can size, never keeps me up at night!"
trebleclef,26-Nov-23,5,"As said, it's Coke Zero, and you're probably here not because you haven't tried it and decided that you already like it, but just to see if it tastes the same when ordered here online. It does. Just be careful. THESE ARE THE TINY CANS, NOT THE REGULAR SIZE CANS. That was my mistake; I thought I was getting the regular sized cans, because I misread the MINI part. That said, if you know what you're getting, these mini cans are more than I'd like to pay, but the mini size is actually perfect, because I often don't drink the whole full-sized can anyway, and so these little mini cans have just enough for one serving. I'll probably get them again intentionally, because I like the mini servings; they're just more expensive than buying the larger cans."
mac,9-Apr-24,3,"the description, doesn't say MINI, the can doesn't say MINI... just the box, which you don't focus on, because it's in the background. before you order, make sure it's the right one"
Gabriel Gama,24-Feb-24,5,It is coke. It is zero. Good enough
Amazon Customer,5-Jan-24,4,"REFRESHMENT FFOR HUBBY, BUT THEY ARE TEENY TINY CANS OF COCA COLA"
Kaylee,22-Feb-24,5,Mini size cans have become my new obsession. Love these!
Natalie,12-Feb-24,5,"Love ordering these through Amazon. Same price as grocery store. Wish Amazon offered more flavors, specifically Dr Pepper and Diet Coke."
william watson,21-Feb-24,5,THE PERFECT SIZE !
Dorothy C. Bordelon,3-Feb-24,5,waiting for my next order to be delivered. nice to have more room in refrigerator with smaller cans
Prazene,26-Jan-24,5,"I love Coke zero. These are the perfect drink to put in your fridge. The bottle is small. When it’s cold, it is just like a normal Coke."
"Diana, sent 1 bottle wrong item I ordered 8 bottles. Paid 32.00 for one Mio, this sucks! Tried to leave message with seller would not work they said no refunds!!",9-Nov-23,4,I like that the amount of a small can is just right and not too much. Great taste .
chlo,4-Nov-23,4,"Honestly, prefer Zero Sugar Pepsi, this coca cola didn't have a very good flavor, but it was tolerable."
janine,17-Jan-24,3,"I tried Diet Coke for the first time and although not as bad as some diet beverages, the artificial sweetener was too noticeable for my taste. The cost is fair and it's nice that they're sold in mini cans, and if the taste and the aftertaste of artificial sweetener doesn't bother you, this soda does taste better than some of the others on the market that I've tried."
Chessie,9-Nov-23,4,Otherwise great.
AT,3-Feb-24,5,Convenient!
Nick,24-Jan-24,5,Like the small cans and taste good
Name,13-Feb-24,3,I only got 2 boxes instead of 3
John Hymel,8-Feb-24,3,Coke box was in bad shape cans were out of Coke box
Amazon Customer,17-Nov-23,5,"All we drink in our house. We go through a lot of Coke Zero. We bought this when things were hard to find during the pandemic and Coke Zero was always sold out. This was a little more expensive than what we usually purchase Coke Zero for, but it got us out of a pinch when we needed it!"
Judy D.,28-Dec-23,5,"I know diet drinks are bad for one's health, but if you want one anyway, this is a good one. Tastes almost like a real coke"
Erika Hernandez,9-Jan-24,5,The taste is better than any dark diet soda I have had.
doctorsister,18-Dec-23,5,I particularly like the size of these zero cokes since I very rarely drink sodas. Convenient and satisfying. 😏
Danita Daley,25-Dec-23,5,These are the perfect size cans and Coke Zero has great taste. Buy them often.
Alissa,26-Nov-23,5,"We drink a lot of Coke Zero, and many of the cans end up partially abandoned on counters & tables throughout the house. The small cans help us reduce the amount of wasted soda!"
Amalthea,28-Dec-23,5,What you would expect from Coca-Cola very good
Tricia,27-Dec-23,5,Just tried the Zero coke! Very impressed.
jamie,11-Jan-24,3,But what isn't these days .. love Amazon fresh
sum1sgirl,14-Dec-23,5,"Not a fan of ""diet soda"" but this actually tastes like an actual coke."
R.JORDAN,14-Aug-23,4,"As above. Fussy review, but Diet Coke is better, and maybe one other Coke type."
cjb,30-Aug-23,4,Just ok I guess
William F. Nappi,30-Sep-22,5,"It's on the sparkly side with a taste I really can't define or precisely pinpoint. At least one reviewer noted it had a pineapple like taste to it.I like the colorful cans. There's less caffeine per 10 oz can (>21 mg) than an 8 oz cup of coffee (~ 35 mg I believe.)I really can't describe the taste except to say it tastes good to me. It just tastes good: contains caffeine and there is no sugar.It contains phenylalanine which I looked up around fifteen years ago and at the time that new word to my vocabulary meant it had positive nutritional value to the extent its not bad for you but instead a good thing.So if there have been no changes to that definition, it's all good.I will buy this again if it isn't discontinued for any reason."
Donna,29-Nov-23,5,"There is usually an aftertaste with soda that is so hyped, but this has a crisp, refreshing taste."
Maureen,13-Dec-23,5,Great taste!!! no bitter after taste!!
Pixie,30-Aug-23,5,"Came in perfect condition !Diet sodas are some of my favorite drinks ever, however my the rest of my family heavily disagrees so we never have them in the house. But luckily amazon pulled through with this one and I got it delivered overnight ! Let's just hope I don't drink them all in a day ^_^,"
Alexandra W,18-Jun-22,5,"I was honestly perplexed the first I saw this was ""space flavored."" As far as I'd heard in the past, space is hypothesized to taste like burnt steak. That really wouldn't be a great flavor. But I was morbidly curious so I bought a bottle.Some people had mentioned it had a flavor reminiscent of campfires and marshmallows, but on my first sip I didn't taste that. I didn't know what I tasted, but I liked it. It took me 2 more bottles to finally identify the flavor.Cotton candy. To me, ""space flavor"" is cotton candy, perhaps with an undertone of cream. It's bright and warm at the same time. Surprisingly, it works really well together. I found myself wanting more of it but it's not sold in any stores near me. I really wish Starlight wasn't a limited time flavor because I love this as much as I used to love vanilla Coke."
Happy Customer,5-Oct-23,5,"Not much to say here it's ""Coke Zero"" if everybody's had that.The size of the cans are just about perfect especially if your pouring some in a glass with ice."
Atlantic 17th,25-Sep-23,5,Coke Zero Mini Cans. The team sometimes needs a little something for their afternoon and they love some coke zero. They gave it two thumbs up and recommends that you try it.
Caroline Vander Meer,9-Oct-23,5,It’s nice to have especially if you have gas you got nice something nice and cold to drink
Angelica,25-Nov-23,5,Nice
Nancy Wesley,7-Nov-23,5,I like the smaller cans and low price
Jen,2-Nov-23,5,Tastes great and doesn’t have the “diet” taste
deb a.,4-Oct-23,5,I buy the mini size so i won't drink too much at once and a full can would go flat..
lighten_up_already,9-Sep-22,4,"This is like a tropical take on Coca-Cola Zero using pineapple up front as the main difference. My description isn't perfect, but it's what comes to mind first as I am a fan of pineapple sparkling water and the new Zevia pineapple flavor of their energy beverage. Someone who like tropical flavored drink and cola might give this a try. I think the flavors are balanced rather well, if a little on the sweet side."
cheyenne daisy,22-Sep-23,5,"Delicious, I love these drinks and the size is perfect to control how much caffeine I am having."
lovedogs,18-Jun-19,5,"I love Coke Zeros. I live many miles away from grocery stores. And as an old person, lugging beverage cans around is no longer possible. I have purchased the 35-can offer about 5 times. Sometimes as low as $10 and sometimes as high as $29. And yes - every case I purchased had a few damage issues. Worst case was have 4 cans completely drained out in the case and several can bottoms bashed so much that the cans will not sit on a flat surface. And even though Amazon keeps changing the price all the time (even when the Coke Zeros are in my cart), even though there is some damage - I will keep buying these 35 can offers from Amazon. The cans stay ice cold in the frig. The 35-can case is much easier to manage than multiple cartons of 12 cokes each. I can manage the bashed bottoms on the cans. I almost never run out of Coke Zeros. I think this is a GREAT value for me. Maybe it will be for you too, if you can ignore the damages and price changing all the time. I love this 35-can option by Amazon for buying Coke Zeros!!!"
Amazon Customer,22-Oct-23,5,I love Coke zero
cas123,9-Oct-23,5,Perfect to kick those sweet cravings
Mason brown,27-Oct-23,3,One of the packs was busted open
nianhong221,17-Oct-23,5,Perfect size/taste.
Irving Steven Sun,12-Oct-23,5,Thank you
Misha Herrera,21-Oct-23,3,Diet Coke better
JOHN,1-Oct-23,5,delivery was great
Rachel Rohr,3-Oct-23,5,Good drink
MSV,23-Sep-23,5,My fav- must buy
david b.,5-Sep-23,5,"Great taste, love the 0 sugar"
Salas,27-Jun-23,5,I love this soda it is much better than dietContain zero sugar we drink this alot in my house hold
"CHEN, CHING-CHI",28-Aug-23,3,Small and avoid drinking too much. Easy to carry
Dr Bank,28-Apr-23,5,Convenient small can of soda. Gives you some caffeine without being too much. Perfect for 1 person trying to limit soda intake but still enjoy a little. Good taste
T. Caillouet,24-Jan-23,5,"Since COVID this is almost impossible to find. I think when I purchased this on Amazon, the cost was fairly reasonable, but it isn't any more. This is my husband's favorite Coke Zero product, but we won't pay Amazon costs any more. He likes plain Coke Zero just fine."
J L J,11-Dec-23,2,"Flat taste....must be really old product! I wasted so much money on this.... Don't waste you money! Coke does still make the Vanilla coke I bought some at my store just a few weeks ago, Much better taste!!!"
Low Blood Sugar,16-Apr-24,1,"They taste like normal. These are a very poor value for the money, because the cans radius is slightly smaller and they are slightly shorter but it causes the amount of liquid in the can to be about 1/2 of the normal can. I am not a fan of the new can design."
Irving,18-Jun-23,3,Came heavily damaged. Box was torn and cans were all bent out of shape.
E. Blake,9-Nov-22,3,I never see any new/limited/weird flavors of Coke where I live so unless I order online I don’t get to taste them. I ordered this and have had a couple of cans so far. It’s a fruity-floral flavor but I can’t say what kind of fruit it tastes like although it’s definitely tropical. I don’t think it’s terrible but I also wouldn’t buy it again. I think the small cans are perfect for this because I’m not sure I’d want a full size 12 oz can in one sitting.
jaime w.,9-Jul-23,5,came undented thanks
missy,5-Feb-20,4,Well the cases were ripped . One split open the moment i picked it up dumping cans on the floor thankfully none of them burst. All the cans seem fine so that’s what matters. I wish they sold this in stores still because after shipping these are expensive . The taste is great though. I love coke vanilla but as a Diabetic I can’t drink regular pop anymore and I don’t like the taste of diets not to mention the aspartame. Zeros are great so over all im happy just wish they were more careful with packing and would lower the price some.
Wen-Wen,2-Nov-22,4,Tasted like Vanilla Coke to me.
Kay,15-Jan-22,4,"although properly boxed and wrapped, a can leaked in the box and got one of the 12 packed soaked. the can was no good as it was empty. For the price, I think I should be able to get a replacement."
Holly Janeshek,4-Mar-23,5,Where do you find the soda at? You cannot get it anywhere the best tasting soda for my money
Susie C,14-Jul-22,5,"I am addicted to this stuff and am sad to see it is going away. The Zero Sugar version is much better than the regular version, but so much harder to find sadly. Coca-Cola if you are listening keep the zero sugar version around!!"
Tash,16-Nov-23,2,Items came in a bag vs the coke box… the cans were individual in the bag. Strange…
Kit,19-Dec-22,5,Tastes like Skittles or Starbursts to friends who tried when I shared. To me it tastes like cotton candy. Enjoyable and wish can find for when I do crave soda
JANE D PLOURDE,16-Dec-22,5,I will NEVER order soda again. The cans were all banged up and although they were all still intact the packing and shipping looks like it was done by a child.
Denise Wieder,1-Nov-22,5,If you like their other than plain flavors it’s good. I can’t figure out how to describe the flavor besides all of them being combined. I like the portion size. I’d get it again
Sandollars,28-Dec-21,5,"This was the only place I could buy this soda because it is not made or shipped to this part of the United States and traveled to Sanibel Florida is where I was able to enjoy the soda flavor.. Wish I could get it for the price I paid, but now I can't afford it."
debra wolinsky,11-Apr-23,5,Good taste.
SCT,20-Mar-24,1,as you can see from the picture the box was opened and the cans were all dented and scattered about inside the box
Amazon Customer,15-Oct-23,2,Taste way too sweet for me the diet coke actually taste a lot better in my opinion
Tas,4-Dec-22,5,I would have called you a whole lie if you told me Zero sugar would be this good. Delicious!!
Grigsby,17-Nov-20,5,OMG Coca-Cola PLEASE bring this flavor back in stores! I cannot find anywhere like I used to be able too and it’s a bit expensive to purchase at $30 for 3 12 packs. This is by far the best pop you can ever get. I just wish it was either more affordable and always in stock on amazon or brought back to retail stores like it used to be at a much more affordable and convenient value.
phoenix53,16-Feb-20,4,"This is the only soft drink I purchase. I like the just-right vanilla flavor it has, plus the drink has no calories.Out of 3 boxes I ordered, 2 were intact. The 3rd box was broken in 2 places; one end was almost completely torn off. Unpacked by holding box upright to keep cokes from falling out."
Beth Newsome,5-Mar-24,1,The photo is for coke zero vanilla but the product is just coke vanilla. not what I wanted at all. Very misleading.
Biscuit,10-Jun-22,5,"Wished CocoCola would release Cherry Coke again, no sugar, full sugar, anything Cherry Coke."
Arron Mc Neill,8-Apr-22,5,"I had very little expectations for this but turned out to not be that bad, the tasted was a little off from what you get from a coke-Zero not as sweet."
Karen R.,13-Oct-22,5,Only rated value for money at three because tastes yummy but cans were so small.
Redhead,15-Feb-23,5,See above.
Marilyn Wilkerson,17-Dec-20,5,"My husband and I both love Cherry Coke Zero. I use it as a reward for eating very carefully all day, becauseof my diabetes. My husband drinks several cans a day, and because there is no sugar, I do NOT worry aboutdamage to his teeth. I just wish we could order it, now that the Pandemic has cut the manufacture of thiswonderful product."
Joseph C.,13-Apr-22,5,It’s a very interesting taste cause it is a bunch of flavors like you get a hint of Carmel and then when you sip it it’s a different flavor
Bing Bing,8-Jan-24,5,Bottled is better but these are cute!
Peter J. Schulte,21-Dec-23,5,"Diet Coke Mini 7-0z is a GOUGE-PRICED item in our Safeway, when it is not sold out.One six-pack retails well above $5.00. I won't say $7.00 because I didn't write it down, but the price is like that. then they have a sale price like, BUY 4 and get $2.00 off.We don't go through it that fast. This purchase of two ten-packs lasts us quite a few weeks. We're grateful to be able to get it here at a reasonable price!"
Tammy Moreno ,10-Apr-24,5,Great product . Very quick delivery
farhan maqsood,29-Feb-24,5,I great for teas like cola Coke diet
karen,28-Jan-24,5,A great product I ordered it for a friend of mine and assisted living and it was delivered just as fast
Colinda,13-Feb-24,4,"Since my tolerance for caffeine is limited, I like the 7.5 ounce cans because they’re just the right size. Aluminum cans are not only recyclable, they are valued by recyclers.I used to assume that you would consume less microplastic by drinking from cans, but a testing lab has shown that this is not the case. I guess the thin plastic lining on the aluminum flakes off. That is very discouraging."
cheryl josefik,9-Feb-24,5,I prefer diet coke if I want a soda! Others are way too sweet!
daniel nevins,31-Dec-23,4,GOOD SODA
Anonymous,18-Jan-24,5,MY MINI FRIDGE HAS DIET AND ZERO SUGAR FREE SODAS. IM PLEASED WITH PURCHASE - RAHILA BERKELEY CA
Decorative tree lamp,25-Dec-23,4,Crisp. Refreshing. Delicious
Ayanna ,16-Jan-24,5,"This is the same as the diet coke in stores, except at a lower price thankfully"
George W.,7-Mar-24,3,I didn't read the listing. These are miniature cans.
RAJ,9-Nov-23,5,As always Diet is the best for everyday needs and occasion.Found a good deal to buy this product.
Mike J.,30-Nov-23,5,Diet Coke in a nice portion size
Benjamin,14-Dec-23,3,We purchase Diet Coke regularly. This particular batch tasted terrible. As if it was diluted. Presumably the flavors in it had lost their stability. The little matter of the expiry date being before our order date may have had something to do with it.
Amy T.,27-Dec-23,3,Package showed up today all beat up with smashed cans that had leaked all over. What a mess!
Kathleen Brander,3-Nov-23,5,Ordered and Delivered. Life is Good!
gloria,29-Apr-23,4,The item was on time and that's a good thing! I'm addicted. But. please put some bubble wrap in the box. Every pack was open on one end. Thanks
Jennifer P. Khazem,4-Sep-23,5,"Again, soda cans are a little higher than in store but I needed them so no problem."
Jimmie Beardsley,30-Sep-23,5,perfect size
Misha Herrera,31-Aug-23,5,12 oz refreshing soda conscience-free sugar-free
Jamie McClure,6-Jun-23,5,Amazon allows a seniors to get deliveries and all are heavy stuff is brought straight to our door it relieves us of a lot of back pain and bending over it is a great service for seniors
KB81,5-May-23,5,Often out of stock but great to have fresh deliver to your door! They are heavy and cannot hang out in the car when it is warm (sweetener is temp sensitive).
Mary I. Oliver,13-Jul-22,3,"Diet and plain coke has a SECRET 'no jitters, no nervousness' caffeine! I can drink 10 a day and never get nervous. Sleep ok. BUT; many doctors admit the artificial sweeteners (aspartame.., are unhealthy, can cause harm.I have called the Coca cola and Pepsi companies for years begging them to make a cola with NO sweetener! Just let us put our OWN sweetener in; fresh or frozen orange juice, lemon... They refuse to do this, or they add in a different toxic artificial sweetener or herb...PLEASE make a us a NO SWEETNER Diet Coke! If major soda businesses will not do this; I hope some other business tries it. (The health food stores have one but its full of that toxic stevia and jitter, nervous causing coffee caffeine.)Maybe the secret caffeine in colas is another chemical and is also unhealthy? Trying to stay on cocoa only.I teach people that sodas, colas are harmful, but secretly I often have addition to them."
Richard Roma,17-Jun-23,5,"What can I say, it's exactly what you'd expect, which is the best diet soda on the planet."
RWm,16-Jun-23,5,"Everything goes better with Coca Cola.Diet, in this case!Mmmm"
M,28-Mar-23,5,"You can't go wrong with soda, it tastes the same as if I went and bought it in store"
Olivia,5-Jun-23,5,Arrived in good condition.
Kelly Rose,6-Mar-23,5,I love diet cokes I can't believe they have tripled in price since 2020 but when your hooked you will pay
Benny,27-Aug-22,5,If your not a big drinker when eating they are the perfect size no waste. I’m reading reviews to small 1 Star review. It makes me laugh mini 7.5 Oz. They ain’t no 12 Oz or 16 Oz. You knew that when you bought em. Why complain then?? You can read!
Angie,9-Apr-23,5,"As described, I would purchase again!"
Sandy o.,17-Sep-22,5,We don't drink soda anymore. But if we get sick with flu this is great for settling tummy. Works just as well as real coke. So I always keep some handy and sent daughter some to plus it's diet so no worries.
Michelle D.,1-Sep-22,5,"After a ten year hiatus of drinking any kind of soda, I started craving diet coke. Does not disappoint, but I need to stop! The aspartame is so bad for you, but it’s addictive!"
Juliana Van Arsdale,13-Mar-23,5,Price should be reduced
Katie H,17-Mar-23,5,It’s very good
A. Wu,5-Jul-21,5,The coke cans are always fresh and nicely delivered by Amazon fresh. I feel Amazon fresh also provides the coke at reasonable prices approx 5 dollars for a 12 pack and often has coupons. Maybe it is better we cut back on soft drinks for our collective health but sometimes it’s nice to have a cold Diet Coke on a hot summer day.
Todd H,24-Sep-21,4,"Well, it's nice to have a carbonated drink. -- That is, if you like it and if it doesn't have an extreme amount of High Fructose Corn Syrup. This product has artificial color, but not High Fructose Corn Syrup."
Sal Scarso,1-Jul-23,3,It taste terrible
Grandma Sunny,18-Feb-23,5,As expected
Cindi Harwood Rose,8-Jun-22,5,Higher than stores but who wants to carry these home? It’s worth it coming to my doorstep at a higher price.
Sabadicci,6-Apr-22,5,I don’t know what’s going on but this is ABSOLUTELY delicious. I know it’s “just” Diet Coke but something changed to make it a party in my mouth.
Diana H.,9-Dec-22,5,Good
Traci,21-Jul-20,3,"Amazon tricked me!!!!! I've been bamboozled!!! I love diet coke. I've always wanted to be that hot skinny bish drinking diet coke surrounded by muscle studs. However Amazon made sure to not include that sweet beverage tax in the original listing price.To my surprise, when I went to view my receipt, I saw $3 tax!!! I thought i was getting a bargain paying $5 for a 12 pack. I was wrong. I will really be combing every detail with a fine tooth comb when it comes to shopping on here now.Now now Amazon, it's ok dear. I forgive you, THIS TIME. Next time, I won't be fooled."
Mary Vargas,25-Aug-22,5,"I like the portion size, not too much"
Anna L.,4-Sep-22,5,The best drink in the world!
D. Coral,21-Dec-20,5,I’ve been drinking this in mass quantity for more than 30 years straight. I’m addicted. Amazon Fresh is my new pimp daddy.
Susan Vanderbilt,7-Sep-20,4,"I would have given this one a perfect rating if it wasn't more expensive than I'm used to buying, and if it was good for me to drink it."
james clifford,10-Apr-22,5,"Great taste, but not a great price"
miya wang,25-May-22,5,Will buy it again
A buyer,30-Aug-21,5,"was good, tasty, and came in no time.makes me buy again sooner than i would need it "
wendy pendergast,31-Dec-21,5,It was fresh and had a good taste .Packed well.
Kelly Moss,15-Apr-24,1,"I bought a 10 pack of mini diet cokes, the box was opened and I was missing 3 cans."
SM11542,30-Jul-20,5,Don't settle for anything less than the real thing! Been a Coca-Cola fan for many years. This is a great multi-pack of 24 cans which provides good value as Coca-Cola never lasts long in our house.
belinda,1-Apr-20,5,"Great prices start at eight dollars which is the standard price for that 24 cans and it went down to seven and then at the end it way down to six, so I bought an extra one. Great value"
James,2-Jun-21,5,Is anyone actually reading this? Is this affecting your decision to buy diet coke in any way?
Sam Cunningham,1-Oct-21,5,It’s Diet Coke I really can’t say anything bad about it.
bruja00001,15-Apr-20,5,All cans arrived with top smashed. Could not drink from can but had to pour coke into glass after forcing dangerous tab out of the way to be able to pour.
Sherri mckowen,22-Feb-22,5,Great price
KMADC,6-Mar-21,5,Everyone should love 12 in the package. Definitely can be a good value for the money.
J. Morse,4-May-19,5,"Tried one again recently and it tasted like battery acid, but was enough to get me on the horse again. Now if I can just kick the habit. Amazon, get that lime la croix back in stock already!"
Danielle,28-Feb-21,5,"Ummm who doesn’t live Diet Coke from a can? It’s quick to drink, and starts with a fizz"
buguy,5-Aug-20,5,"Apparently i misread the add. I never would have paid $20 for a $5 12 pack of soda. I thought it was 12, 12 packs!"
Book_Guru,20-May-20,5,"Delicious flavor, but a 24 pack is not enough to fill a standard bath tub. I will probably be ordering a few more to complete this task."
Ally,30-Mar-21,5,I’m addicted to DC and always looking for the best price. Good deal!
Gloria Pollock,9-Apr-24,1,products are within a month of expiration.
audio video lover,31-Jul-20,5,"I especially like that it's caffeinated. On many occasions, the caffeine has helped stave off a migraine headache."
Deana Blake,15-Jul-20,5,I love drinking Diet Coke. I like how it’s in a case of 24. The price is very reasonable too.
Ms coco,16-Apr-20,5,"Definitely worth to buy, thank you amazon! During this time still keep the high quality of delivery and price reasonable!"
Amanda Osmond,14-Feb-21,5,We got diet Cokes and there amazing good
Travis Dommert,16-Jul-20,5,Nothing fancy...just what you'd expect. A case of Diet Coke delivered to your door. 
Rody,2-Jun-20,5,This was a great value and gets delivered to my door. What else could I ask for?
Russell A. Duncan,2-Mar-20,5,Diet Coke delivered to your door is a huge convenience. The product seemed fresh and the price was very competitive.
Jane Bettis,13-Apr-22,3,They are tiny. Turns out I like bigger cans.
Robin,29-Apr-18,5,I’m addicted at this point. No way around it. I’ve accepted my fate. The delivery’s awesome. Apologies to the delivery driver that has to bring this stuff to my house because I drink so much of it.
Back to the Office,28-Jun-23,2,Disliked that I received dented cans.

mombird,14-May-21,5,My favorite cola.
Robin Cantrell,29-Feb-24,1,Its additive and is terrible to drink alot of bad ingredients.

HarryPotter,23-Feb-21,5,Good
M Norris,21-Aug-20,3,"Love Diet Coke, but cases were delivered from Fresh damaged, so all the cans are bulging out at the bottom. Makes the soda taste flat somehow"

Gadget Girl,28-Mar-20,5,Who doesn’t want an ice cold Diet Coke?!?

Kat Metcalf,23-May-20,5,Diet Coke is great.
Mark Leberfinger,8-Apr-24,5,"I’m happy with the quick shipping. The Diet Coke tastes great, and it was at a great price."
Brianna Brier,23-Feb-24,5,"perfect! crisp flavor, and cheap. I always love purchasing Diet Coke on Amazon."

diane johnson,4-Apr-24,5,"Glad to have this show up on my doorstep, not for every day usage, but for special occasions when i want a little cool bubbly drink."
Paula Sawyer,28-Mar-24,5,Always love have my dc around. The better prices helps a lot.
NCS,9-Apr-24,4,"There is nothing wrong with this item. Came quick, well packed, no leaks or dents and tastes great. My only issue is that the expiration date on the bottles is May 24, 2024. Today is April 9, 2024. They expire at the end of next month. That is a bit too soon! 6 weeks? I think it should be a longer window. So, -1 star for this. Love the price, but please sell fresh product."
Lee Ann Zuliani,11-Apr-24,5,This has got to be my guilty pleasure. I know it is not supposed to be good for you but I absolutely love it.
Terence,13-Mar-24,5,cause i like having it on hand and i don't drink that much so i suggest you stock up.....i doubt retailers are going to drop the price.....plus they package it great to avoid leakage
Connie P,3-Apr-24,4,"My husband and I both drink a lot of Diet Coke. (I usually drink Caffeine Free Diet Coke.) We both love the flavor, the fact is doesn't have any calories, and the way it quenches our thirst. We are aware, however, of the potential negative health effects of its ingredients. The price has really gone up since the pandemic, with Amazon's price being on par with our grocery store sale prices."
Signy,9-Apr-24,4,I have been receiving Coke Zero.it is okay but I would rather have Diet Coke.I thought that was what I ordered.
Eureka ,11-Apr-24,5,It was nice
Jennifer Holloman,6-Apr-24,5,Love it excellent taste
logan,24-Mar-24,4,Would be five stars since it’s the same price as Walmart but they’re usually just one week or so from the best by date.
Brenda Wagner,26-Mar-24,5,Cheaper than in the store. Delivered so I don't have to haul it.
Amber,27-Mar-24,5,As stated. The price is right and delivery is great

Allyson,13-Mar-24,5,Good value and flavor!
ashley,7-Mar-24,5,I snagged this at a good price. Cheaper than the stores.
Thomas,14-Feb-24,5,Diet Coke was a good deal so I decided to chance ordering it which I was a little hesitant on as I've order cans of pop before but it exploded but the bottles made it in perfect condition. Will be ordering again.
Bill Rihel,8-Mar-24,5,Good price
Joegolfer,22-Feb-24,5,Tastes great for a diet drink. The plastic bottles aren’t as good as glass but ten times better than cans.
John plotz,4-Mar-24,5,I like it very much
Ycc,9-Mar-24,5,Good
Adele C. Conway-Davis,1-Nov-23,4,"Nice having my fav soda delivered. Coke could lower the price a bit. I wish there was something besides plastic it could go in, since I don't have recycling here at the small complex. Amazons aluminum can Diet Coke is to expensive. I just get the bottles for back up when I run out of grocery store can Diet Coke."
Sleep one ,30-Jan-24,5,Like it size just right
Kindle Customer,6-Jan-24,5,"Amazon driver was so careful with them in this terrible weather. I appreiate that. Diet coke is a treat. Wish these bottles were not so expensive, but they are really good."
Amazon Customer,13-Dec-23,4,Love Diet coke however the shipping takes weeks!

Ruby Bailey,3-Apr-24,3,Love this
Amber Hughes,11-Nov-23,5,"The one thing that I usually run out here in my household are cans or bottles of soda, diet soda. There aren't many places to do this, so when I found these, I was elated. The price was great, the taste is great, they weren't flat, and knowing this, I will happily buy these again. So thankful to have this option."
Girlygirl,12-Jan-24,5,I have on auto ship and delivery is usually delayed.My only complaint.
Steve in the Rockies,1-Jan-24,5,Great value for Diet Coke fans. Only con is slow delivery. So order early and you'll be happy.
spstack,16-Dec-23,5,Good value considering what they charge at the grocery store. Usually have to buy 4 12 packs to get a deal. These are brought every 2 weeks to my door!
Teresa B,1-Dec-23,5,"I get this for my Mom, she can’t drink the full bottle and the lid keeps it carbonated for her. There’s no need to waste any pop."
Terah,22-Dec-23,5,I love Diet Coke. It's packaged for ease of travel.
Christian Dazz,24-Feb-24,3,Really hard to open for thirst
Sarah,17-Dec-23,5,"Love, take a while to ship but besides that, no complaints"
Robert B. Campbell,3-Dec-23,5,I find it very convenient to have heavier items delivered. This is particularly true for things that I buy all the time.
RAJ,9-Nov-23,5,Good flavor and taste .Plastic bottles and handy and can carry easily anywhere without chance of breakage.Taste and quality is always refreshing and tasty
Lii,19-Dec-23,5,Good
LT.,4-Sep-23,5,I had to be able to say Coke and ask for it myself. That was the rule in the house. Been a loyal customer and look there is one on the table.. my favorite way to drink it is flat and cold.. mmmmmm with a Andes cream dimint
Shari Henry,10-Nov-23,5,Wish you could get more at one time
L. Yates,31-Oct-23,5,Exactly as described and shown
chris anderson,21-Oct-23,5,I wish they would use stevia
Sunmi park,29-Oct-23,5,It’s affordable
Mike J.,6-Oct-23,5,"Classic Diet Coke taste, not Pepsi huss!"
Kenneth E. Ferrari,13-Oct-23,5,great price. quick delivery
Susan C,4-Apr-24,2,My subscription is for 3 six packs each month. I only received 1 six pack. Update: Have now received all ordered. Thanks.
theweecoyote,6-Dec-22,5,"My husband is addicted to this stuff. There are certain meals that he must have a bottle of Diet Coke to help him wash down the food with. Italian Beef or a Gyro require a bottle of this tasty elixir of the Gods. Oatmeal does not. A medium pizza alla vodka with sausage, peppers, onions and black olives needs a 2 little bottle before the pizza can be consumed. Pasta e Fagioli soup does not require diet coke. A big hunk of crusty Italian bread is requested though...But all in all, a 12 pack of Diet Coke makes the weekly grocery list. Personally, I like Ginger Ale."
Jennifer P. Khazem,30-Sep-23,5,Good soda
Karen Wiemers,22-Aug-23,5,I love it...you charged me for one but sent me four.
Misha Herrera,31-Aug-23,5,Very refreshing my only guilty pleasure.
Bob,27-Oct-23,3,"great deal, received on time"
"Love it, Great buy.",18-Aug-23,5,Freshness
Heatherbrent,29-Mar-24,1,"I have been getting these Diet Coke bottles delivered for a few weeks hoping they would get better. They have not. The bottle are dirty, plastic is faded and the bottle barely makes that carbonation noise when opened meaning the taste is very flat. These seem like they were warehoused somewhere and they just found them and put them for sale on Amazon because you would never see anything like this in a store. I cancelled my subscription and will just get these from the store from now on."
Committed to God,21-Feb-20,5,"I'm quoting from the internet here because you deserve the facts...""Diet Coke was introduced in 1982, and despite health concerns, the Thank-God-It's-Not-Sugar-But-Hopefully-Aspartame-Won't-Kill-You beverage is doing better than ever.For many years Diet Coke held the title of the second most popular soda in the world (after regular Coke) — more than 40% of colas were Diet Coke colas (this may have changed somewhat) — In a 2012 article by Katie JM Baker, she called it ""Liquid Crack"" (in jest of course) ...but in all seriousness, I believe it is still the one to beat, and potentially always will be. Nothing is better than an ice-cold diet coke!Tip: The bottled variety of Diet Coke is better by far than the cans... if the bottles are not available, I would rather wait to purchase - the difference is just that distinct, but of course the final decision is yours to make."
Cortnay Gray,12-Jan-24,2,About a month until the ones I was sent expire. If you are a quick consumer this probably doesn't matter.
Nora Lee,5-Oct-22,4,Great product but you can find it less expensive in stores.
michelle garcia,24-Nov-23,2,I got this product and was excited because it was convenient / the price was good. But they expired 2 weeks after I got them :/ buyers beware
M,28-Mar-23,5,Good for the price!
R.JORDAN,23-Feb-23,5,Better in some ways than nn-sugars
AlbericM,17-Jan-23,3,"I buy this for my friends who like to mix it with their alcohol. They're happy, I'm happy. Don't know why it's so hard to find the 2-liter bottles on Amazon."
E Shapiro,24-Apr-22,4,Rather have caffeine free. You seem to have a consistent problem with your coke inventory
Terri K,29-Aug-23,2,I ordered a six pack of diet Coke. I received in a very timely fashion and I appreciate it but the Diet Coke is flat probably not the best way to buy my soda.
Mary 35,9-Mar-24,1,"I always order 5 six packs every 3 weeks, lately I’ve been only getting 3. Besides the fact that I don’t get the amount I requested most times I’m getting products that are extremely close to the expiration date"
Julia Gil,5-Oct-22,5,Love the size bottle but too expensive now
Jimbo,19-Jul-22,5,I know everyone likes Pop. Diet coke stands out among the rest
Beth ,13-Nov-22,5,It's coke. Standard
joanna,3-Oct-22,5,Like
Katrina Louise,8-Aug-22,5,Just like it should.
"Mike D., La Jolla",20-Jan-19,5,"People think I'm toying with death by drinking an entire bottle almost every day. For decades. But here I am feeling well and apparently cancer free according to my gastroenterologist. It's refreshing, tastes great, it won't make you obese like regular Coke, and by all accounts it's non-carcinogenic. I'll be the first to know if I'm wrong about the latter point."
KA LaMesa,15-May-20,4,Shortage of the cans of Diet Coke forced me to select this. Same taste but it takes up a lot of room in the refrigerator
JordyH77b,12-Apr-21,4,Nice quality & supa crisp. Diet coke for life homie
Janice Scarborough,9-Aug-23,2,The drinks were very flat. And I was very disappointed.
Dann G.,29-Oct-23,2,Tasted Flat
H20Lily,24-Jan-24,1,"From the thick plastic bottles to the taste, everything about this product is sketchy. It doesn't even taste like Diet Coke which I've drank for years. In fact, I had an allergic reaction after a couple sips. Will never order again."
Don Trice,24-Jun-22,5,Excellent
Vickie J,28-Mar-21,5,I have been craving coke. So refreshing. Hope coke doesn't mess with their diet. Disappointed when the tweaked their diet lime.
Shopper,13-Mar-20,5,These are a good buy especially when you can get an additional percentage off. It is so convenient to have these bulkier items sent to my doorstep. Love this size of bottle too!
Danielle,10-Jun-20,4,"i prefer diet pepsi, but there havent been any 2 liters lately. decent alternative."
Sean,3-Mar-21,5,"You should know what to expect. If you're a fan, you're a fan. If not, then beat it kid!"
Jay,2-Mar-21,5,Addicted to Diet Coke. Perfect sized bottle for on the go. IMO Diet Coke is superior to Diet Pepsi.
Mbiker,13-Mar-24,1,"Bought this a few times now because of low price, but tastes old"
Cal Ward,23-Feb-24,1,"Best by date is Jan 15, 2024.The Diet Coke is flat and tastes like tart sugar water."
Lisa Rastellini,3-Aug-21,5,Great price and super refreshing!!!
Minké,2-Oct-23,1,This item doesn’t taste like the one I purchase at the grocery store. It has a weird salty flavor and is flat. No wonder it had a special price. It also has an expiration date which is in a few days. Will NOT buy again
Amazon Customer,7-Sep-23,1,"My diet coke sodas are all flat. No fizz or flavor and certainly,no great taste. Deeply disappointed and feeling ripped off. I just got them the first week of September then,I noticed the expiration date of October,next month. You ought to be ashamed of selling products like this."
Teresa Faranda,31-Oct-20,5,Diet Coke is my favorite soft drink but it's disappearing lately. It's never in stock.
Raymond Norman,18-Jan-24,1,Takes too long to ship and too long to arrive. not worth the extra cost. it's diet coke....how long can it possibly take to box and ship?
tripzz,23-Jun-20,5,this stuff can be habit forming . nothing goes better with whiskey or a cup of ice
Gadget Girl,28-Mar-20,5,What can I say? Diet Coke in a bottle! Works for me for on the go!
Mindy Hofstatter,26-Feb-24,1,product expired 3 weeks after delivery
Roger W Lemons,14-Feb-24,1,Tasted like plastic not worth the wait!!!
